Description: Long period linear random number generator WELL19937a by
        F. Panneton, P. L'Ecuyer and M. Matsumoto. The initialization
        algorithm allows to seed the generator with a
        numeric vector of an arbitrary length and uses MRG32k5a by
        P. L'Ecuyer to achieve good quality of the initialization. The
        output function may be set to provide numbers from the interval
        (0,1) with 53 (the default) or 32 random bits. WELL19937a is of
        similar type as Mersenne Twister and has the same period.
        WELL19937a is slightly slower than Mersenne Twister, but has
        better equidistribution and "bit-mixing" properties and faster
        recovery from states with prevailing zeros than Mersenne
        Twister. All WELL generators with orders 512, 1024, 19937 and
        44497 can be found in randtoolbox package.
