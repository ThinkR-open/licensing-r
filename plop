## Definition 

### Free software

Defining what is a free software (free beer vs free speech, https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html )

### Open source

> Open source doesn’t just mean access to the source code.

+ permit non-exclusive commercial exploitation of the licensed work
+ must make available the work’s source code
+ must permit the creation of derivative works from the work itself

> 1. Free Redistribution
> The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.

> 2. Source Code
> The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form. Where some form of a product is not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost, preferably downloading via the Internet without charge. The source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program. Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed.

> 3. Derived Works
> The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.

> 4. Integrity of The Author's Source Code
> The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of "patch files" with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code. The license may require derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original software.

> 5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups
> The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons> .

> 6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor
> The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.

> 7. Distribution of License
> The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.

> 8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product
> The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part of a particular software distribution. If the program is extracted from that distribution and used or distributed within the terms of the program's license, all parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the original software distribution.

> 9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software
> The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source software.

> 10. License Must Be Technology-Neutral
> No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.

- Free Redistribution 

- Available source code & compiled code. If not available with the program, "there must be a well-publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost–preferably, downloading via the Internet without charge"
- Derived work : The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.

### License

Defining what is a license. 

### Source Code

> The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. 

### Standard Interface

> A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

### System Libraries

> The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

### Corresponding Source

> The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.

### Modify 

> To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html

### Propagate

> To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. 

https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html

### Convey 

> To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

### Library 

What does "distributing a software" means?

Distribution == share the source code in files ? 

Putting AGPL on a server == distribute (Network Protective licenses).

#### Linking a library 



## Classification 

Find a good way to classify licenses, maybe inspired by: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#Introduction


## Implication

What are the implications of choosing a license? 

## License compatibility

Not all licenses are compatible, see for example Apache & GPL which have a one way compatibility: http://www.apache.org/licenses/GPL-compatibility.html
