Writing R Extensions Disclaimer This book is by no mean a legal book and should not be used as such. This book aims at helping you decipher the complexity of open source licenses, but if you have legal concerns and questions about open source licenses, please refer to a professional lawyer. This book focuses on licensing R and R-related works. Hence a focus is made on GPL licenses (which are the licenses under which R is released). If you think there is a mistake somewhere, or if you want to contribute, please open an issue. What is this book about This book aims at two things: Documenting the current state of licensing in the R world Helping developers make strategic choices about the license they apply to their R packages by summarizing and explaining licenses and technical terms specific to open source licensing. Content Chapter 1 - Introduction explores the current state of Open Source licenses by the number, by downloading and exploring the data from CRAN and BioConductor databases. Chapter 2 - What is a license (and why you should care) gives a series of definition about common terms you’ll find while browsing software licenses. Chapter 3 - Licenses in the R World Chapter 4 - Common patterns for licensing R Chapter 5 - A Practical Guide Chapter 6 - Summary Special Thanks This book is sponsored by an RConsortium ISC grant. Many thanks to them for supporting the project. A special thank to Miles McBain, who inspired this project. "],

This book aims at helping you decipher the complexity of open source licenses, but if you have legal concerns and questions about open source licenses, please refer to a professional lawyer. Show / Hide all code 1.1 Diving into the CRAN &amp; BioConductor database Before going deeper into the licenses, let’s first have a look into the licenses currently used on CRAN &amp; BioConductor. library(tidyverse) theme_set(theme_minimal()) Note: this version has been compiled on : Sys.time() ## [1] &quot;2019-07-23 13:00:18 CEST&quot; 1.1.1 Get all the packages First, let’s get a list of all the packages. We’ll extract the list of packages from CRAN using the CRAN_package_db() function from {tools}, and the ones from BioConductor by reading the file at &quot;https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/PACKAGES&quot;. These two datasets contain the metadata about the packages, as they are provdided in the DESCRIPTION file. # Getting the DB cran_db &lt;- tools::CRAN_package_db() %&gt;% thinkr::clean_names() %&gt;% mutate(src = &quot;cran&quot;) bioc_db &lt;- read.dcf(url(&quot;https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/PACKAGES&quot;)) %&gt;% as.data.frame() %&gt;% thinkr::clean_names() %&gt;% mutate(src = &quot;bioc&quot;) full_db &lt;- bind_rows(cran_db, bioc_db) These two lists contain: 14604 packages from CRAN 1735 packages from BioConductor So a total of 16339 packages. 1.1.2 Data cleansing Let’s now select the columns of interest: the ones containing the informations about licenses, and have a look at the 6 first rows of the result. db &lt;- full_db %&gt;% select(package, contains(&quot;license&quot;), src) head(db) 1.2 Extracting information 1.2.1 Counting the licenses # Number of licences n_licence &lt;- db %&gt;% distinct(license) %&gt;% count() %&gt;% pull(n) In our dataset, we can find 177 different licences. # Number of licences with &#39;file&#39; db &lt;- db %&gt;% mutate(has_file_license = str_detect(license, &quot;file&quot;)) n_has_file_license &lt;- db %&gt;% count(has_file_license) n_file &lt;- n_has_file_license %&gt;% filter(has_file_license) %&gt;% pull(n) Out of these 16339 packages, 2676 contain a licence file — see #TODO add ref for more info about adding licence files. 1.2.2 Packages with non-foss / restrictive-use licenses The dataset also contains a column called license_is_foss and one called License_restricts_use. Fields ‘License_is_FOSS’ and ‘License_restricts_use’ may be added by repositories where information cannot be computed from the name of the license. ‘License_is_FOSS: yes’ is used for licenses which are known to be FOSS, and ‘License_restricts_use’ can have values ‘yes’ or ‘no’ if the LICENSE file is known to restrict users or usage, or known not to. Writing R Extensions license_is_foss &lt;- db %&gt;% count(license_is_foss) %&gt;% drop_na() The license_is_foss (Free Open Source Software) column is not that much informative, as only 13 packages have provided it. But what can be interesting is the 1 package(s) that contains a non-foss license: full_db %&gt;% filter(license_is_foss == &quot;no&quot;) %&gt;% select(package, license, src) We’ll get back on this license in #TODO add ref. license_restricts_use &lt;- db %&gt;% count(license_restricts_use) %&gt;% drop_na() Let’s now have a look at the license_restricts_use column from the dataset. Few packages (2) have this field filled in their DESCRIPTION. Just as before, it can be interested to have a look at the packages that have do restrict the use. All the packages with a licence that restricts the use db %&gt;% filter(license_restricts_use == &quot;yes&quot;) %&gt;% select(package, license, src) And if we want to have a look at the number of each of these licenses: db %&gt;% filter(license_restricts_use == &quot;yes&quot;) %&gt;% count(license, sort = TRUE) As we can see, the majority of packages with a licence that restricts the use are based on a license file. system.file(&quot;LICENSE&quot;, package = &quot;rngwell19937&quot;) %&gt;% readLines() %&gt;% glue::as_glue() ## This code can be used freely for personal, academic, or non-commercial purposes. ## ## For commercial purposes, see the conditions formulated in file rngwell19937/src/WELL19937a.c. system.file(&quot;LICENSE&quot;, package = &quot;gpclib&quot;) %&gt;% readLines() %&gt;% glue::as_glue() ## Free for non-commercial use; commercial use prohibited (see the files ## `gpc.c&#39; and `gpc.h&#39; for details) We’ll get back on this license in #TODO add ref. 1.3 Getting a more global idea There are several ways to insert a license : It can be restricted to precise version (e.g. GPL-3) It can be “at least” a version (e.g. GPL (&gt;= 2)) It can be two licenses (e.g. GPL-2 | GPL-3) It can be accompanied with a LICENSE file (e.g. LGPL-3 | file LICENSE) Also, the license number can be either a number or a number + a zero (e.g GPL (&gt;= 2.0)). So far, we have counted the number of different licenses based on a strict match of characters. So GPL (&gt;= 2.0) and GPL (&gt;= 2) are counted as two different licenses. In order to get a broader idea, we’ll clean this column so that we can gather the licenses together. cleaner &lt;- compose( # Removing the file license elements ~ gsub(&quot;filelicense&quot;, &quot;&quot;, .x), ~ gsub(&quot;filelicense&quot;, &quot;&quot;, .x), # Removing empty spaces ~ gsub(&quot; &quot;, &quot;&quot;, .x), # Removing all non-alpha numeric character proustr::pr_keep_only_alnum, # Removing the .0 at the end of numbers ~ gsub(&quot;\\\\.0&quot;, &quot;&quot;, .x), tolower ) db &lt;- db %&gt;% mutate(clean_license = cleaner(license)) db %&gt;% count(clean_license, sort = TRUE) As you can see, we now have 105, while we originally had 177 different licenses. Note: this process was designed to have a broad overview of the licenses, and gathered together the GPL (&gt;= 2.0) and GPL-2 for example. It’s designed more as a tool for general overview. 1.3.1 How many GPL related licenses? Let’s have a look at how many licenses are GPL realted, by detecting the &quot;gpl&quot; string in the license column. # How many GPL based licenses ? n_gpl &lt;- str_detect(db$clean_license, &quot;gpl&quot;) %&gt;% sum(na.rm = TRUE) 13010 packages have a license which is a version of GPL Which makes 79.6254361% of the packages. 1.3.2 The 10 most frequent licenses? Let’s see which are the 10 most frequent licenses: db %&gt;% count(clean_license, sort = TRUE) %&gt;% top_n(10) ## Selecting by n 1.4 A visual representation of the licenses db %&gt;% count(clean_license, sort = TRUE) %&gt;% top_n(10, n) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(reorder(clean_license, n), n )) + geom_col() + coord_flip() + labs( title = &quot;10 most used licenses on the CRAN / Bioconductor&quot;, subtitle = glue::glue(&quot;Made on the {Sys.Date()}&quot;), x = &quot;License&quot;, y = &quot;Volume&quot; ) db %&gt;% filter(src == &quot;cran&quot;) %&gt;% count(clean_license, sort = TRUE) %&gt;% top_n(10, n) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(reorder(clean_license, n), n )) + geom_col() + coord_flip() + labs( title = &quot;10 most used licenses on the CRAN&quot;, subtitle = glue::glue(&quot;Made on the {Sys.Date()}&quot;), x = &quot;License&quot;, y = &quot;Volume&quot; ) db %&gt;% filter(src == &quot;bioc&quot;) %&gt;% count(clean_license, sort = TRUE) %&gt;% top_n(10, n) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(reorder(clean_license, n), n )) + geom_col() + coord_flip() + labs( title = &quot;10 most used licenses on Bioconductor&quot;, subtitle = glue::glue(&quot;Made on the {Sys.Date()}&quot;), x = &quot;License&quot;, y = &quot;Volume&quot; ) "],
["whatis.html", "Chapter 2 What is a license (and why you should care) 2.1 Copyright is everywhere 2.2 Key terms of licensing 2.3 Warranties", " Chapter 2 What is a license (and why you should care) Disclaimer: This book is by no mean a legal book and should not be used as such. This book aims at helping you decipher the complexity of open source licenses, but if you have legal concerns and questions about open source licenses, please refer to a professional lawyer. Show / Hide all code 2.1 Copyright is everywhere Licensing is an hard but essential part of any software project: it defines what others can and cannot do with the piece of code you’ve written… “It is very important that you include license information! Otherwise, it may not even be legally correct for others to distribute copies of the package, let alone use it.” Writting R Extension And, it’s everywhere: [C]opyright is automatically attached to every novel expression of an idea, whether through text, sounds, or imagery. (…) the words in this paragraph are protected by copyright as soon as they are written. Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing - Andrew M. St. Laurent So any kind of newly created piece of code is protected by copyright as soon as it’s written down. Which means that if a software developer doesn’t attach a license to their code, or a too restrictive license, it can be hard (or even impossible) to (re)use the software. Let’s have a look for example at the bootstrap library. In this issue from 2012, a user asked for a License change: cweagans wants to include the bootstrap library inside a Drupal distribution, but Bootstrap’s license at that time being APLv2, it was incompatible with GPLv2. After almost two years (and 213 comments on the issue), Bootstrap switched to an MIT license. And, as the comment on the issue relates, “The remaining Apache-only commits were reverted by #11927 and replaced by rewritten, MIT-licensed commits in #11928”, meaning that some code had to be rewritten to be complient with the new MIT license. But this was not an easy task: if you decide to change from one license to another, you need to get the permission from all the contributors. This was for example the case in Bootstrap (“The fun part of this effort will be getting every contributors explicit permission to make the change”): more than 530 people had contributed to the project (more than 1000 at the time of writting) at the time of the license change… The R package {covr} had the same mechanism, when Jim Hester wanted to switch from MIT to GPL-3. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. CC-BY-SA-4.0 On the other hand, going for a license which is too permissive can allow anybody to reuse your code: for commercial purposes, and even for military purpose. This is for example the reason why some contributors to Bootstrap didn’t want to change to the MIT: they had concern about patent and / or commercial reuse of the software. For example, the MIT License, which is very permissive, allows to do (almost) anything with the software licensed under it. TODO : also, giving an open source license prevents from any liability on the code. But first, some definitions. 2.2 Key terms of licensing Licence is a document that defines how a piece of software, as a whole, can be used, reused, modified, distributed, and linked to. Let’s start by gathering some definition about these terms. Disclaimer: there are disagreement about some definition of these terms. The definition below are gathered from various sources, and should be taken as guideline, not as legal advices. 2.2.1 Use and reuse As defined in Artistic-2.0, You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not Distribute the Modified Version. GPL: =&gt; Can use the modified version “privately” without any necessity to redistribute. 2.2.2 Source code &amp; package As defined in AGPL-3, The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. As defined in Artistic-2.0, “Package” means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version. As defined in GNU FAQ, An “aggregate” consists of a number of separate programs, distributed together on the same CD-ROM or other media. The GPL permits you to create and distribute an aggregate, even when the licenses of the other software are nonfree or GPL-incompatible. The only condition is that you cannot release the aggregate under a license that prohibits users from exercising rights that each program’s individual license would grant them. 2.2.3 Standard &amp; Modified versions As defined in AGPL-3, To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work. As defined in Artistic-2.0, “Standard Version” refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder. “Modified Version” means the Package, if it has been changed, and such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder. As defined in CC-BY-SA-4.0, Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor 2.2.4 Distribute &amp; Convey As defined in Artistic-2.0, “Distribute” means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside of your company or organization. selling or giving away Distribution == share the source code in files ? Putting AGPL on a server == distribute (Network Protective licenses). As defined in AGPL-3, To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. 2.2.5 Distribute &amp; use privately 2.2.6 Link to Static linking: the code is bundled withing the package. Static linking is the result of the linker copying all library routines used in the program into the executable image. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing)#Static_linking) As defined in Artistic-2.0, You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Example: {shiny} : https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/tree/master/inst/www/shared Dynamic linking: loading the shared library at run time. the executable code still contains undefined symbols, plus a list of objects or libraries that will provide definitions for these. Loading the program will load these objects/libraries as well, and perform a final linking. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing)#Dynamic_linking) As defined in Artistic-2.0, Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license. Package dependencies for R package, and for R itself. When releasing a package, you’re not bundling R inside the package, the package has to be run on a machine that contains R. 2.3 Warranties From THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

From the GNU GPL FAQ: Does the GPL have different requirements for statically vs dynamically linked modules with a covered work? (#GPLStaticVsDynamic) No. Linking a GPL covered work A 'covered work' means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. (GPL-3 license) statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on the GPL covered work. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination. As we can see in this part of the GPL FAQ, “Linking a GPL covered work statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on the GPL covered work”. That would mean that, as R is GPL, any work linking dynamically or statically to R would have to be GPL-based also. 3.1.2 Is an R extension linking? Most of the time, when we are creating R-extensions, we’re building packages. Packages enhance R in the sense that they are extention to R, and they add functionnalities in an R runtime, not to R itself. Which seems to match the definition of a plug-in: In computing, a plug-in (or plugin, add-in, addin, add-on, or addon) is a software component that adds a specific feature to an existing computer program. When a program supports plug-ins, it enables customization. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing) The R Core team uses a quite similar term (“add-on”) to describe R packages: packages are named “add-on” packages in the R Installation and Administration manuals. As said before, this book is not legal advice but aims at providing elements to understand how lincensing works. Here are elements from the GPL FAQ that provide information about the status of an R package, regarding wether or not R license impacts the choice of a package license According to FSF Free Software Foundation , any derivative work of GPL licensed work is to be licensed under GPL-compatible license. In the GPL FAQ, “When is a program and its plug-ins considered a single combined program?”, the FSF states that : It depends on how the main program invokes its plug-ins. If the main program uses fork and exec to invoke plug-ins, and they establish intimate communication by sharing complex data structures, or shipping complex data structures back and forth, that can make them one single combined program. A main program that uses simple fork and exec to invoke plug-ins and does not establish intimate communication between them results in the plug-ins being a separate program. If the main program dynamically links plug-ins, and they make function calls to each other and share data structures, we believe they form a single combined program, which must be treated as an extension of both the main program and the plug-ins. If the main program dynamically links plug-ins, but the communication between them is limited to invoking the ‘main’ function of the plug-in with some options and waiting for it to return, that is a borderline case. In the GPL FAQ, “If I write a plug-in to use with a GPL-covered program, what requirements does that impose on the licenses I can use for distributing my plug-in?”, the FSF states that : If the main program and the plugins are a single combined program then this means you must license the plug-in under the GPL or a GPL-compatible free software license and distribute it with source code in a GPL-compliant way. A main program that is separate from its plug-ins makes no requirements for the plug-ins. In the GPL FAQ, “Can I apply the GPL when writing a plug-in for a nonfree program?”, the FSF states that : If the main program and the plugins are a single combined program then this means you must license the plug-in under the GPL or a GPL-compatible free software license and distribute it with source code in a GPL-compliant way. A main program that is separate from its plug-ins makes no requirements for the plug-ins. We’ll leave to the reader the appreciation about wether or not an R package can be considered as an addin which is separate from R as a program. 3.2 Package Licenses Most of the time, when you are talking about R extensions, we are talking about R packages, which are to be “officially” distributed through CRAN and / or Bioconductor. 3.2.1 “Officially Authorized” Licenses From R Licenses. The “GNU Affero General Public License” version 3 (AGPL) The “Artistic License” version 2.0 The “BSD 2-clause License” The “BSD 3-clause License” The “GNU General Public License” version 2 (GPLv2) The “GNU General Public License” version 3 (GPLv3) The “GNU Library General Public License” version 2 (LGPLv2) The “GNU Lesser General Public License” version 2.1 (LGPLv2.1) The “GNU Lesser General Public License” version 3 (LGPLv3) The “MIT License” The “Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike International License” version 4.0 (CC BY-SA 4) Note that all these licenses are found in the list of GPL compatible licenses, with the exception of CC BY-SA, which is : one-way compatible with the GNU GPL version 3: this means you may license your modified versions of CC BY-SA 4.0 materials under GNU GPL version 3, but you may not relicense GPL 3 licensed works under CC BY-SA 4.0. https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#ccbysa You’ll also find on the Creative Common compatibility list that CC BY-SA version 4.0 is compatible with GPL, version 3 only, and also one-way compatible. 3.2.2 From Bioconductor “License:” field: should preferably refer to a standard license (…) using one of R’s standard specifications. Be specific about any version that applies (e.g., GPL-2). Core Bioconductor packages are typically licensed under Artistic-2.0. To specify a non-standard license, include a file named LICENSE in your package (containing the full terms of your license) and use the string “file LICENSE” (without the double quotes) in this “License:” field. The package should contain only code that can be redistributed according to the package license. Be aware of the licensing agreements for packages you are depending on in your package. Not all packages are open source even if they are publicly available. BioConductor Package Guidelines 3.3 Classifying the 11 “official” licenses Now that we have seen these 11 “official” licenses, how can you choose one?

CeCILL is a French, GPL-Compatible license that comes in three flavors: CeCILL (version 1, 2, and 2.1), CeCILL-B and CeCILL-C. The idea behind this new license was to create “a license which is compatible with French laws and with the principles from anglo-saxon open source licenses.” (our translation from French). .right{ text-align: right;} CeCILL - Objectifs Note that CeCILL-B &amp; CeCILL-C are non GPL-compatible 3.4.2 Restrictive licenses Let’s now have a look at the licenses which the author(s) choose to list as “restricts uses”: ru &lt;- db %&gt;% filter(license_restricts_use == &quot;yes&quot;) %&gt;% select(package, license, src) ru What is a “restrictive use” of a package? According to GNU, A program is free software if the program’s users have the four essential freedoms: The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0). The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2). The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this. .right{ text-align: right;} What is free software? So how can a package be “restrictive” in the sense of the GNU definition of Free Software? It can for exemple: Prohibit from commercial use, which is restrictive in the sense of freedom 0. This is for example what you can find in: {gpclib} readLines( system.file(&quot;LICENSE&quot;, package = &quot;gpclib&quot;) ) %&gt;% glue::as_glue() ## Free for non-commercial use; commercial use prohibited (see the files ## `gpc.c&#39; and `gpc.h&#39; for details) {rngwell19937} readLines( system.file(&quot;LICENSE&quot;, package = &quot;rngwell19937&quot;) ) %&gt;% glue::as_glue() ## This code can be used freely for personal, academic, or non-commercial purposes. ## ## For commercial purposes, see the conditions formulated in file rngwell19937/src/WELL19937a.c.

The number of &#39;possible circumstances&#39; easily explodes in a function that has several input parameters and can run in several environments (hardware, OS, OS version, R version etc.). Therefore the R development team might develop some kind of automated mechanism, which distributes small shares of the necessary combinations to each user of the software and the user contributes the test results to the R project. ## ## What is &#39;reasonable support&#39;? ## Support is reasonable if QA ## - does not ask for the users time beyond triggering if/when to donate regression testing ## - does not ask for more than 1% of the users CPU time (used for R) ## - does not ask for huge bandwidth (only transmission of test parameters and results, no transmission of code, no transmission without the users agreement) ## - does not impose security threads to the user, especially ## - - the user must not be forced to disclose his identity ## - - regression tests must be completely transparent (open source and already part of the package, not transferred at test time) ## - - the transfer of test parameters and test results must be completely transparent (no encryption, e.g. plain html) ## ## Copyright 2007 Jens Oehlschl&lt;e4&gt;gel "],
["rlicense.html", "Chapter 4 Common patterns for licensing R 4.1 R-package 4.2 About contribution 4.3 Documentation", " Chapter 4 Common patterns for licensing R Disclaimer: This book is by no mean a legal book and should not be used as such. This book aims at helping you decipher the complexity of open source licenses, but if you have legal concerns and questions about open source licenses, please refer to a professional lawyer. Show / Hide all code Before examining in more depth the link between your package and it environment, let’s remind that chosing a license is crucial in defining how your package / code can be used and reused. For example, MIT allows to do almost anything with your code (including copying and pasting your code in a paid, commercial, non-open software), while other licenses are less permissive. 4.1 R-package In this first part, we’ll be talking about lincensing R packages. Here are the several cases: All packages need R / I’m making a package that only depends on base I’m creating a package that has dependencies listed in the DESCRIPTION file, that might be installed at the same time as my package I’m creating a package that has dependencies on internal files that are fully copied and pasted I’m creating a package designed to access data 4.1.1 R &amp; {base} All packages need R / I’m making a package that only depends on base Do you need to have a GPL-compatible license? That’s a question your law department should answer, but here is the part from the GNU FAQ that might help you get an answer. In the GPL FAQ, “Can I apply the GPL when writing a plug-in for a nonfree program?”, the FSF states that : If the main program and the plugins are a single combined program then this means you must license the plug-in under the GPL or a GPL-compatible free software license and distribute it with source code in a GPL-compliant way. A main program that is separate from its plug-ins makes no requirements for the plug-ins. Note also that CRAN allows packages that are licensed under a non GPL-compatible license: for example, Artistic License 1.0 or Common Public License Version 1.0, or the Lucent Public License full_db %&gt;% filter(str_detect(license, &quot;Artistic-1&quot;)) %&gt;% select(package, license) full_db %&gt;% filter(str_detect(license, &quot;Common Public License Version 1.0&quot;)) %&gt;% select(package, license) full_db %&gt;% filter(str_detect(license, &quot;Lucent&quot;)) %&gt;% select(package, license) The CRAN policies states: Packages with licenses not listed at https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/share/licenses/license.db will generally not be accepted. Here is the list of these licenses: download.file(&quot;https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/share/licenses/license.db&quot;, &quot;licenses.dcf&quot;) cran_l &lt;- read.dcf(&quot;licenses.dcf&quot;) %&gt;% as_tibble() %&gt;% select(Name, Abbrev, Version) unlink(&quot;licenses.dcf&quot;) Note that these 39 licenses are more than the 11 licenses officially listed on the r-project, and that some of these are not GPL-Compatible (for example Artistic License 1.0 or European Union Public License (EUPL) version 1.1) Some other licenses are accepted, for example the “Unlimited” license: full_db %&gt;% filter(str_detect(license, &quot;Unlimited&quot;)) %&gt;% select(package, license) We can also find this restriction concerning licensing of package in the CRAN policies: The package’s license must give the right for CRAN to distribute the package in perpetuity. .right{ text-align: right;} CRAN Repository Policy 4.1.2 Dependencies in DESCRIPTION There are three ways you can list package dependencies in the DESCRIPTION: Depends: the package is installed at the same time as your package, and it is loaded (attached to your search path) when you load your package. For example, the {ggraph} package has listed in Depends the {ggplot2} package, so when you do library(ggraph), it also attach {ggplot2} to the searchPath. Imports: the package is installed at the same time as your package, and it is not loaded (attached to your search path) when you load your package. Yet you can use the functions from the package you’ve listed in your NAMESPACE. For example, the {ggraph} package has listed in Depends the {Rcpp} package. But when you do library(ggraph), {Rcpp} is not attached to your searchPath. Note that here, both {Rcpp} and {ggplot2} are installed when you install {ggraph}. Suggests: the package is not installed at the same time as your package, and it is not loaded (attached to your search path) when you load your package. For example, the {ggraph} package has listed in Suggests the {network} package. We will not classify each of this behavior, but be aware of these three behaviors, and wether or not they classify as one or two programs, or wether or not your package us a modified work of the dependencies is very much subject to interpretation and of the level of interactions between the packages. That being said, we can assume that at least Depends and Imports do dynamic linking, as defined as the executable The executable here being the package code still contains undefined symbols, plus a list of objects or libraries that will provide definitions for these. Loading the program will load these objects/libraries as well, and perform a final linking. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing)#Dynamic_linking) And remember that this is the statement from the GPL FAQ about dynamic linking: Linking a GPL covered work&quot;, statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on the GPL covered work. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination. On a more pragmatic level, let’s think for a minute about using a dependency which has restrictions, like one with the ACM license, preventing from any commercial use without explicit consent from the author. If one of these packages is listed in Depends or Imports, it will be installed with your package, and elements of the NAMESPACE of this package will be used when your package is used. So this kind of dependency mught be problematic if you choose to go for a more lax license. For example, MIT allows to make commercial use of your code. And it might be understood that allowing your code to be used anywhere would contradict the restriction imposed by one of the needed dependencies. 4.1.3 Including someone else’s code I’m creating a package that has dependencies on internal files that are fully copied and pasted Including someone else’s code can cover several things: adding a C file which is compiled with the package adding a piece of R code from another package adding code in another language It’s a little bit more clear that you are doing static linking therre: Static linking is the result of the linker copying all library routines used in the program into the executable image. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing)#Static_linking) As you are copying and pasting code from one work into yours, it’s more clear that you are doing static linking. Here, you should respect the license under which the code you’re using is licensed. For example, MIT allows to freely reused the code Where code is copied (or derived) from the work of others (including from R itself), care must be taken that any copyright/license statements are preserved and authorship is not misrepresented. .right{ text-align: right;} CRAN Repository Policy Be careful: the constant in almost every open source licenses is that you should add the disclaimer of non liability in the code you’re using. So if ever you are using another library, don’t forget to add in your license file what library you are using, and what the license of this specific piece of code is. 4.1.3.1 Bundling JavaScript files These files are used at running time, they are not compiled when the package is installed. the {leaflet} package: https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet This package, designed to do interactive cartography, bundles a series of JavaScript files inside it, not written by the author of the R package. The license of the package is GPL-3, and it is combined with a LICENSE.note file, which starts as such: The leaflet package as a whole is distributed under GPL-3 (GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE version 3). The leaflet package includes other open source software components. The following is a list of these components (full copies of the license agreements used by these components are included below): And then you’ll find a list of all the licenses for the various elements to be found in the package. Also, the list of all authors from the various external elements is to be found in the DESCRIPTION cat(packageDescription(&quot;leaflet&quot;)[[&quot;Author&quot;]]) ## Joe Cheng [aut, cre], ## Bhaskar Karambelkar [aut], ## Yihui Xie [aut], ## Hadley Wickham [ctb], ## Kenton Russell [ctb], ## Kent Johnson [ctb], ## Barret Schloerke [ctb], ## jQuery Foundation and contributors [ctb, cph] (jQuery library), ## Vladimir Agafonkin [ctb, cph] (Leaflet library), ## CloudMade [cph] (Leaflet library), ## Leaflet contributors [ctb] (Leaflet library), ## Leaflet Providers contributors [ctb, cph] (Leaflet Providers plugin), ## Brandon Copeland [ctb, cph] (leaflet-measure plugin), ## Joerg Dietrich [ctb, cph] (Leaflet.Terminator plugin), ## Benjamin Becquet [ctb, cph] (Leaflet.MagnifyingGlass plugin), ## Norkart AS [ctb, cph] (Leaflet.MiniMap plugin), ## L.

In other word, they are not “external calls”, they become a core of the resulting R package. This is for example what we’ve seen with the {rngwell19937} package in the previous chapter: readLines( system.file(&quot;LICENSE&quot;, package = &quot;rngwell19937&quot;) ) %&gt;% glue::as_glue() ## This code can be used freely for personal, academic, or non-commercial purposes. ## ## For commercial purposes, see the conditions formulated in file rngwell19937/src/WELL19937a.c.

In this GitHub issue, we can find three common patterns for building a data package: data bundled inside the package, data accessed through an API, data access for files that are online but not through an API. 4.1.4.1 Data bundled inside the package This kind of behavior is close to the one from package bundling code written by someone else: if you’re packing data inside a package, then the global package should be compatible with the license of the dataset. Including a dataset inside a package that has a non compatible license can create breaking changes where you have to either remove the dataset from the package, or switch the package license. This is for example what happened with the {tidytext} package - when first writting the package, Julia Silge and David Robinson included several datasets, and released the package as MIT. We used the knowledge we had at the time and followed the practices we saw other OSS packages for text analysis following. However, it turns out that this was not the right approach from a licensing standpoint, because the lexicon licenses were not the same as the package’s license .right{ text-align: right;} Fixing your Mistakes: Sentiment Analysis Edition So what to do next? As Julia describes in her blogpost, she reached out to every dataset author to get there authorization (or not) to use the dataset in an MIT licensed package : So, where does that leave us? The sentiment lexicon of Bing Liu and collaborators is still a dataset within tidytext, as he has explicitly given permission for us to include it there. If you need a sentiment lexicon to use in another R package, this is the easiest one to use. The AFINN lexicon is available through textdata, under an OSS license different from tidytext’s license. The sentiment lexicon of Loughran and McDonald for financial documents is available through textdata for research purposes, but you must obtain a license from the creators for commercial use. The NRC lexicon is currently not available through any package I am involved in. .right{ text-align: right;} Fixing your Mistakes: Sentiment Analysis Edition So to sum up, two datasets have switched to the {textdata} package (see next section), one is still in {tidytext} as the author has explicitely given the authorization to do so, and one is not available. Another example, the {igraphdata}, which is released under XX and has a file LICENSE with each licenses for each dataset listed: readLines( system.file(&quot;LICENSE&quot;, package = &quot;igraphdata&quot;) ) %&gt;% glue::as_glue() ## This files lists the copyright holders and licenses (if known) of the ## various data sets in the igraphdata package: ## ## Koenigsberg ## ----------- ## ## This data set was collected from Public Domain sources, and it is ## int the Public Domain itself. ## ## Please cite the following publication if you use this data set: ## ## Euler, L.: Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis. ## Commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae, 128-140, 1741. ## ## ## UKfaculty ## --------- ## ## This dataset is licensed under a Creative Commons ## Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 UK: England &amp; Wales License, ## see http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/uk/ for details. ## ## Please cite the following reference if you use this dataset: ## ## Nepusz T., Petróczi A., Négyessy L., Bazsó F.: Fuzzy communities and ## the concept of bridgeness in complex networks.

By contrast, ## our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to ## share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free ## software for all its users. ## ## When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not ## price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you ## have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for ## them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you ## want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new ## free programs, and that you know you can do these things. ## ## Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights ## with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer ## you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute ## and/or modify the software. ## ## A secondary benefit of defending all users&#39; freedom is that ## improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they ## receive widespread use, become available for other developers to ## incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and ## encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of ## software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. ## The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and ## letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its ## source code to the public. ## ## The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ## ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available ## to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to ## provide the source code of the modified version running there to the ## users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version, on ## a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source ## code of the modified version. ## ## An older license, called the Affero General Public License and ## published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is ## a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has ## released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under ## this license. ## ## The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and ## modification follow. ## ## TERMS AND CONDITIONS ## ## 0. Definitions. ## ## &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License. ## ## &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of ## works, such as semiconductor masks. ## ## &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this ## License. Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. &quot;Licensees&quot; and ## &quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations. ## ## To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work ## in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an ## exact copy. The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the ## earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work. ## ## A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based ## on the Program. ## ## To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without ## permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for ## infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a ## computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, ## distribution (with or without modification), making available to the ## public, and in some countries other activities as well. ## ## To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other ## parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through ## a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. ## ## An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot; ## to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible ## feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) ## tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the ## extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the ## work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If ## the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a ## menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. ## ## 1. Source Code. ## ## The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work ## for making modifications to it. &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source ## form of a work. ## ## A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official ## standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of ## interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that ## is widely used among developers working in that language. ## ## The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other ## than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of ## packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major ## Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that ## Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an ## implementation is available to the public in source code form. A ## &quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component ## (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system ## (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to ## produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. ## ## The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all ## the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable ## work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to ## control those activities. However, it does not include the work&#39;s ## System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free ## programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but ## which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source ## includes interface definition files associated with source files for ## the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically ## linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, ## such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those ## subprograms and other parts of the work. ## ## The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users ## can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding ## Source. ## ## The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that ## same work. ## ## 2. Basic Permissions. ## ## All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of ## copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated ## conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited ## permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a ## covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its ## content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your ## rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. ## ## You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not ## convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains ## in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose ## of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you ## with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with ## the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do ## not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works ## for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction ## and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of ## your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. ## ## Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under ## the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 ## makes it unnecessary. ## ## 3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. ## ## No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological ## measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article ## 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or ## similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such ## measures. ## ## When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid ## circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention ## is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to ## the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or ## modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s ## users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of ## technological measures. ## ## 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. ## ## You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you ## receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and ## appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; ## keep intact all notices stating that this License and any ## non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; ## keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all ## recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. ## ## You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, ## and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. ## ## 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. ## ## You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to ## produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the ## terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: ## ## a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified ## it, and giving a relevant date. ## ## b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is ## released under this License and any conditions added under section ## 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to ## &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;. ## ## c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this ## License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This ## License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 ## additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, ## regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no ## permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not ## invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. ## ## d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display ## Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive ## interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your ## work need not make them do so. ## ## A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent ## works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, ## and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, ## in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an ## &quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not ## used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users ## beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work ## in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other ## parts of the aggregate. ## ## 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. ## ## You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms ## of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the ## machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, ## in one of these ways: ## ## a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product ## (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the ## Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium ## customarily used for software interchange. ## ## b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product ## (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a ## written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as ## long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product ## model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a ## copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the ## product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical ## medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no ## more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this ## conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the ## Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. ## ## c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the ## written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This ## alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and ## only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord ## with subsection 6b. ## ## d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated ## place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the ## Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no ## further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the ## Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to ## copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source ## may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) ## that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain ## clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the ## Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the ## Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is ## available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. ## ## e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided ## you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding ## Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no ## charge under subsection 6d. ## ## A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded ## from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be ## included in conveying the object code work. ## ## A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any ## tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, ## or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation ## into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, ## doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular ## product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a ## typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status ## of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user ## actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product ## is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial ## commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent ## the only significant mode of use of the product. ## ## &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods, ## procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install ## and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from ## a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must ## suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object ## code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because ## modification has been made. ## ## If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or ## specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as ## part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the ## User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a ## fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the ## Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied ## by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply ## if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install ## modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has ## been installed in ROM). ## ## The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a ## requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates ## for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for ## the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a ## network may be denied when the modification itself materially and ## adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and ## protocols for communication across the network. ## ## Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, ## in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly ## documented (and with an implementation available to the public in ## source code form), and must require no special password or key for ## unpacking, reading or copying. ## ## 7. Additional Terms. ## ## &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this ## License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. ## Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall ## be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent ## that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions ## apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately ## under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by ## this License without regard to the additional permissions. ## ## When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option ## remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of ## it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own ## removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place ## additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, ## for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. ## ## Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you ## add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of ## that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: ## ## a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the ## terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or ## ## b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or ## author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal ## Notices displayed by works containing it; or ## ## c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or ## requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in ## reasonable ways as different from the original version; or ## ## d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or ## authors of the material; or ## ## e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some ## trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or ## ## f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that ## material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of ## it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for ## any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on ## those licensors and authors. ## ## All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further ## restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you ## received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is ## governed by this License along with a term that is a further ## restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains ## a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this ## License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms ## of that license document, provided that the further restriction does ## not survive such relicensing or conveying. ## ## If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you ## must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the ## additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating ## where to find the applicable terms. ## ## Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the ## form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; ## the above requirements apply either way. ## ## 8. Termination. ## ## You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly ## provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or ## modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under ## this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third ## paragraph of section 11). ## ## However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your ## license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) ## provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and ## finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright ## holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means ## prior to 60 days after the cessation. ## ## Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is ## reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the ## violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have ## received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that ## copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after ## your receipt of the notice. ## ## Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the ## licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under ## this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently ## reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same ## material under section 10. ## ## 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. ## ## You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or ## run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work ## occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission ## to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, ## nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or ## modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do ## not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a ## covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. ## ## 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. ## ## Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically ## receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and ## propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible ## for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. ## ## An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an ## organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an ## organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered ## work results from an entity transaction, each party to that ## transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever ## licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could ## give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the ## Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if ## the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. ## ## You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the ## rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may ## not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of ## rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation ## (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that ## any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for ## sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. ## ## 11. Patents. ## ## A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this ## License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The ## work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s &quot;contributor version&quot;. ## ## A contributor&#39;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims ## owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or ## hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted ## by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, ## but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a ## consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For ## purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant ## patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of ## this License. ## ## Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free ## patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to ## make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and ## propagate the contents of its contributor version. ## ## In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express ## agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent ## (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to ## sue for patent infringement). To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a ## party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a ## patent against the party. ## ## If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, ## and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone ## to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a ## publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, ## then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so ## available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the ## patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner ## consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent ## license to downstream recipients. &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have ## actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the ## covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work ## in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that ## country that you have reason to believe are valid. ## ## If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or ## arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a ## covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties ## receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify ## or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license ## you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered ## work and works based on it. ## ## A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within ## the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is ## conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are ## specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered ## work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is ## in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment ## to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying ## the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the ## parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory ## patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work ## conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily ## for and in connection with specific products or compilations that ## contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, ## or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. ## ## Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting ## any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may ## otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. ## ## 12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom. ## ## If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or ## otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not ## excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a ## covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this ## License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may ## not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you ## to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey ## the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this ## License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. ## ## 13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License. ## ## Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the ## Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users ## interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version ## supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding ## Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source ## from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary ## means of facilitating copying of software. This Corresponding Source ## shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 ## of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the ## following paragraph. ## ## Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have ## permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed ## under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single ## combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this ## License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, ## but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version ## 3 of the GNU General Public License. ## ## 14. Revised Versions of this License. ## ## The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of ## the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions ## will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to ## address new problems or concerns. ## ## Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the ## Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General ## Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the ## option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered ## version or of any later version published by the Free Software ## Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the ## GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published ## by the Free Software Foundation. ## ## If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future ## versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s ## public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you ## to choose that version for the Program. ## ## Later license versions may give you additional or different ## permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any ## author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a ## later version. ## ## 15. Disclaimer of Warranty. ## ## THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY ## APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT ## HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY ## OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ## THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR ## PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM ## IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ## ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. ## ## 16. Limitation of Liability. ## ## IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING ## WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS ## THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY ## GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE ## USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF ## DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD ## PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), ## EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ## SUCH DAMAGES. ## ## 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. ## ## If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided ## above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, ## reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates ## an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the ## Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a ## copy of the Program in return for a fee. ## ## END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS ## ## How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs ## ## If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest ## possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it ## free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. ## ## To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest ## to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively ## state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least ## the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. ## ## &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt; ## Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt; ## ## This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify ## it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by ## the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or ## (at your option) any later version. ## ## This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, ## but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of ## MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the ## GNU Affero General Public License for more details. ## ## You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License ## along with this program. If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;. ## ## Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. ## ## If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer ## network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to ## get its source. For example, if your program is a web application, its ## interface could display a &quot;Source&quot; link that leads users to an archive ## of the code. There are many ways you could offer source, and different ## solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the ## specific requirements. ## ## You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, ## if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary. ## For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see ## &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;. 7.2 The “Artistic License” version 2.0 ## Artistic License 2.0 ## ## Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation. ## ## Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this ## license document, but changing it is not allowed. ## ## Preamble ## ******** ## ## This license establishes the terms under which a given free software ## Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.

If the ## terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to ## make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a ## different licensing arrangement. ## ## Definitions ## *********** ## ## &quot;Copyright Holder&quot; means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in ## the copyright notice for the entire Package. ## ## &quot;Contributor&quot; means any party that has contributed code or other ## material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder&#39;s ## procedures. ## ## &quot;You&quot; and &quot;your&quot; means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or ## modify the Package. ## ## &quot;Package&quot; means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright ## Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A ## given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified ## Version. ## ## &quot;Distribute&quot; means providing a copy of the Package or making it ## accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, ## to others outside of your company or organization. ## ## &quot;Distributor Fee&quot; means any fee that you charge for Distributing this ## Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It does ## not mean licensing fees. ## ## &quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or ## has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright ## Holder. ## ## &quot;Modified Version&quot; means the Package, if it has been changed, and such ## changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder. ## ## &quot;Original License&quot; means this Artistic License as Distributed with the ## Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be ## modified by The Perl Foundation in the future. ## ## &quot;Source&quot; form means the source code, documentation source, and ## configuration files for the Package. ## ## &quot;Compiled&quot; form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any ## other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of ## the Source form. ## ## Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution ## ******************************************************** ## ## (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use ## Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you ## do not Distribute the Modified Version. ## ## Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version ## ****************************************************** ## ## (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the ## Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, ## either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all ## of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your ## discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form ## of the Package. ## ## (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other ## modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting ## Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will ## be subject to the Original License. ## ## Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source ## ********************************************************** ## ## (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or ## for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the ## Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from ## the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any ## non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do ## at least ONE of the following: ## ## (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the ## Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright ## Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version. ## ## (b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent ## the user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the ## Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the ## Standard Version. ## ## (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the ## Source form of the Modified Version available to others under ## ## (i) the Original License or ## ## (ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and ## redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that ## apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the ## Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, ## be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but ## Distributor Fees are allowed. ## ## Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified ## ****************************************************************** ## Versions without the Source ## *************************** ## ## (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without ## the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to ## get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid ## at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any time ## while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must ## provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If ## you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days ## after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do ## not forfeit any of your rights under this license. ## ## (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the ## Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the ## Source of the Modified Version. ## ## Aggregating or Linking the Package ## ********************************** ## ## (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or ## Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting ## aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the ## Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other ## components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license ## apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions ## as included in the aggregation. ## ## (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other ## works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build ## stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the ## Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the ## result does not expose a direct interface to the Package. ## ## Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version ## ******************************************************** ## ## (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that ## merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause ## the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not ## considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms ## of this license. ## ## General Provisions ## ****************** ## ## (10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified ## Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or ## distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, ## or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license. ## ## (11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version ## made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure ## that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this ## license. ## ## (12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, ## service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder. ## ## (13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge ## patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and ## otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims ## licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the ## Package. If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or ## counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes ## direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License ## to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed. ## ## (14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT ## HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS &quot;AS IS&#39; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED ## WARRANTIES.

By contrast, the GNU General Public ## License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free ## software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This ## General Public License applies to most of the Free Software ## Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to ## using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by ## the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to ## your programs, too. ## ## When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not ## price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you ## have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for ## this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it ## if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it ## in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. ## ## To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid ## anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. ## These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you ## distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. ## ## For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether ## gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that ## you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the ## source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their ## rights. ## ## We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and ## (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, ## distribute and/or modify the software. ## ## Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain ## that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free ## software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we ## want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so ## that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original ## authors&#39; reputations. ## ## Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software ## patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free ## program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the ## program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any ## patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all. ## ## The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and ## modification follow. ## ## GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE ## TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION ## ## 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains ## a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed ## under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, ## refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; ## means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: ## that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, ## either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another ## language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in ## the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. ## ## Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not ## covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of ## running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program ## is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the ## Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). ## Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. ## ## 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s ## source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you ## conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate ## copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the ## notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; ## and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License ## along with the Program. ## ## You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and ## you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. ## ## 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion ## of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and ## distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 ## above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: ## ## a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices ## stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. ## ## b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in ## whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any ## part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third ## parties under the terms of this License. ## ## c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively ## when run, you must cause it, when started running for such ## interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an ## announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a ## notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide ## a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under ## these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this ## License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but ## does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on ## the Program is not required to print an announcement.) ## ## These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If ## identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, ## and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in ## themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those ## sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you ## distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based ## on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of ## this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the ## entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. ## ## Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest ## your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to ## exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or ## collective works based on the Program. ## ## In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program ## with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of ## a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under ## the scope of this License. ## ## 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, ## under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of ## Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: ## ## a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable ## source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections ## 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, ## ## b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three ## years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your ## cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete ## machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be ## distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium ## customarily used for software interchange; or, ## ## c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer ## to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is ## allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you ## received the program in object code or executable form with such ## an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) ## ## The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for ## making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source ## code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any ## associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to ## control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a ## special exception, the source code distributed need not include ## anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary ## form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the ## operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component ## itself accompanies the executable. ## ## If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering ## access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent ## access to copy the source code from the same place counts as ## distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not ## compelled to copy the source along with the object code. ## ## 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program ## except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt ## otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is ## void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. ## However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under ## this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such ## parties remain in full compliance. ## ## 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not ## signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or ## distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are ## prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by ## modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the ## Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and ## all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying ## the Program or works based on it. ## ## 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the ## Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the ## original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to ## these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further ## restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein. ## You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to ## this License. ## ## 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent ## infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), ## conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or ## otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not ## excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot ## distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this ## License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you ## may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent ## license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by ## all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then ## the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to ## refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. ## ## If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under ## any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to ## apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other ## circumstances. ## ## It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any ## patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any ## such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the ## integrity of the free software distribution system, which is ## implemented by public license practices. Many people have made ## generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed ## through that system in reliance on consistent application of that ## system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing ## to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot ## impose that choice. ## ## This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to ## be a consequence of the rest of this License. ## ## 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in ## certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the ## original copyright holder who places the Program under this License ## may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding ## those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among ## countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates ## the limitation as if written in the body of this License. ## ## 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions ## of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will ## be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to ## address new problems or concerns. ## ## Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program ## specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any ## later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions ## either of that version or of any later version published by the Free ## Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of ## this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software ## Foundation. ## ## 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free ## programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author ## to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free ## Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes ## make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals ## of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and ## of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. ## ## NO WARRANTY ## ## 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY ## FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN ## OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES ## PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED ## OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF ## MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS ## TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE ## PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, ## REPAIR OR CORRECTION. ## ## 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING ## WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR ## REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, ## INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING ## OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED ## TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY ## YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER ## PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE ## POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ## ## END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS ## ## How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs ## ## If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest ## possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it ## free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. ## ## To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest ## to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively ## convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least ## the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. ## ## &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt; ## Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt; ## ## This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify ## it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by ## the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or ## (at your option) any later version. ## ## This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, ## but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of ## MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the ## GNU General Public License for more details. ## ## You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along ## with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., ## 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA. ## ## Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. ## ## If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this ## when it starts in an interactive mode: ## ## Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author ## Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;. ## This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it ## under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details. ## ## The hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate ## parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may ## be called something other than `show w&#39; and `show c&#39;; they could even be ## mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. ## ## You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your ## school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if ## necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names: ## ## Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program ## `Gnomovision&#39; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker. ## ## &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989 ## Ty Coon, President of Vice ## ## This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into ## proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may ## consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the ## library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General ## Public License instead of this License. 7.6 The “GNU General Public License” version 3 ## GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE ## Version 3, 29 June 2007 ## ## Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt; ## Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies ## of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. ## ## Preamble ## ## The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for ## software and other kinds of works. ## ## The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed ## to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, ## the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to ## share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free ## software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the ## GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to ## any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to ## your programs, too. ## ## When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not ## price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you ## have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for ## them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you ## want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new ## free programs, and that you know you can do these things. ## ## To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you ## these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have ## certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if ## you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. ## ## For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether ## gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same ## freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive ## or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they ## know their rights. ## ## Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: ## (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License ## giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. ## ## For the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains ## that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users&#39; and ## authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as ## changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to ## authors of previous versions. ## ## Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run ## modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer ## can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of ## protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software. The systematic ## pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to ## use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we ## have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those ## products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we ## stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions ## of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. ## ## Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. ## States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of ## software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to ## avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could ## make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that ## patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. ## ## The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and ## modification follow. ## ## TERMS AND CONDITIONS ## ## 0. Definitions. ## ## &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. ## ## &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of ## works, such as semiconductor masks. ## ## &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this ## License. Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. &quot;Licensees&quot; and ## &quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations. ## ## To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work ## in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an ## exact copy. The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the ## earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work. ## ## A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based ## on the Program. ## ## To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without ## permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for ## infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a ## computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, ## distribution (with or without modification), making available to the ## public, and in some countries other activities as well. ## ## To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other ## parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through ## a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. ## ## An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot; ## to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible ## feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) ## tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the ## extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the ## work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If ## the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a ## menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. ## ## 1. Source Code. ## ## The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work ## for making modifications to it. &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source ## form of a work. ## ## A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official ## standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of ## interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that ## is widely used among developers working in that language. ## ## The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other ## than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of ## packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major ## Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that ## Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an ## implementation is available to the public in source code form. A ## &quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component ## (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system ## (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to ## produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. ## ## The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all ## the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable ## work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to ## control those activities. However, it does not include the work&#39;s ## System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free ## programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but ## which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source ## includes interface definition files associated with source files for ## the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically ## linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, ## such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those ## subprograms and other parts of the work. ## ## The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users ## can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding ## Source. ## ## The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that ## same work. ## ## 2. Basic Permissions. ## ## All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of ## copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated ## conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited ## permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a ## covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its ## content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your ## rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. ## ## You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not ## convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains ## in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose ## of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you ## with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with ## the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do ## not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works ## for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction ## and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of ## your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. ## ## Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under ## the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 ## makes it unnecessary. ## ## 3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. ## ## No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological ## measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article ## 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or ## similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such ## measures. ## ## When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid ## circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention ## is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to ## the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or ## modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s ## users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of ## technological measures. ## ## 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. ## ## You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you ## receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and ## appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; ## keep intact all notices stating that this License and any ## non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; ## keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all ## recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. ## ## You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, ## and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. ## ## 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. ## ## You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to ## produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the ## terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: ## ## a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified ## it, and giving a relevant date. ## ## b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is ## released under this License and any conditions added under section ## 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to ## &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;. ## ## c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this ## License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This ## License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 ## additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, ## regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no ## permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not ## invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. ## ## d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display ## Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive ## interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your ## work need not make them do so. ## ## A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent ## works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, ## and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, ## in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an ## &quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not ## used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users ## beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work ## in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other ## parts of the aggregate. ## ## 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. ## ## You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms ## of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the ## machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, ## in one of these ways: ## ## a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product ## (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the ## Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium ## customarily used for software interchange. ## ## b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product ## (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a ## written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as ## long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product ## model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a ## copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the ## product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical ## medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no ## more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this ## conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the ## Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. ## ## c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the ## written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This ## alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and ## only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord ## with subsection 6b. ## ## d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated ## place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the ## Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no ## further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the ## Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to ## copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source ## may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) ## that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain ## clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the ## Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the ## Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is ## available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. ## ## e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided ## you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding ## Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no ## charge under subsection 6d. ## ## A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded ## from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be ## included in conveying the object code work. ## ## A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any ## tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, ## or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation ## into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, ## doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular ## product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a ## typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status ## of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user ## actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product ## is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial ## commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent ## the only significant mode of use of the product. ## ## &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods, ## procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install ## and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from ## a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must ## suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object ## code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because ## modification has been made. ## ## If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or ## specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as ## part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the ## User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a ## fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the ## Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied ## by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply ## if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install ## modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has ## been installed in ROM). ## ## The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a ## requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates ## for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for ## the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a ## network may be denied when the modification itself materially and ## adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and ## protocols for communication across the network. ## ## Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, ## in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly ## documented (and with an implementation available to the public in ## source code form), and must require no special password or key for ## unpacking, reading or copying. ## ## 7. Additional Terms. ## ## &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this ## License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. ## Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall ## be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent ## that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions ## apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately ## under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by ## this License without regard to the additional permissions. ## ## When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option ## remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of ## it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own ## removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place ## additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, ## for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. ## ## Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you ## add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of ## that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: ## ## a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the ## terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or ## ## b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or ## author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal ## Notices displayed by works containing it; or ## ## c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or ## requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in ## reasonable ways as different from the original version; or ## ## d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or ## authors of the material; or ## ## e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some ## trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or ## ## f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that ## material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of ## it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for ## any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on ## those licensors and authors. ## ## All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further ## restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you ## received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is ## governed by this License along with a term that is a further ## restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains ## a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this ## License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms ## of that license document, provided that the further restriction does ## not survive such relicensing or conveying. ## ## If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you ## must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the ## additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating ## where to find the applicable terms. ## ## Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the ## form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; ## the above requirements apply either way. ## ## 8. Termination. ## ## You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly ## provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or ## modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under ## this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third ## paragraph of section 11). ## ## However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your ## license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) ## provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and ## finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright ## holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means ## prior to 60 days after the cessation. ## ## Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is ## reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the ## violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have ## received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that ## copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after ## your receipt of the notice. ## ## Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the ## licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under ## this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently ## reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same ## material under section 10. ## ## 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. ## ## You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or ## run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work ## occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission ## to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, ## nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or ## modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do ## not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a ## covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. ## ## 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. ## ## Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically ## receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and ## propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible ## for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. ## ## An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an ## organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an ## organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered ## work results from an entity transaction, each party to that ## transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever ## licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could ## give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the ## Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if ## the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. ## ## You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the ## rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may ## not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of ## rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation ## (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that ## any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for ## sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. ## ## 11. Patents. ## ## A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this ## License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The ## work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s &quot;contributor version&quot;. ## ## A contributor&#39;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims ## owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or ## hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted ## by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, ## but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a ## consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For ## purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant ## patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of ## this License. ## ## Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free ## patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to ## make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and ## propagate the contents of its contributor version. ## ## In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express ## agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent ## (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to ## sue for patent infringement). To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a ## party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a ## patent against the party. ## ## If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, ## and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone ## to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a ## publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, ## then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so ## available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the ## patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner ## consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent ## license to downstream recipients. &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have ## actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the ## covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work ## in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that ## country that you have reason to believe are valid. ## ## If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or ## arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a ## covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties ## receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify ## or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license ## you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered ## work and works based on it. ## ## A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within ## the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is ## conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are ## specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered ## work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is ## in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment ## to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying ## the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the ## parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory ## patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work ## conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily ## for and in connection with specific products or compilations that ## contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, ## or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. ## ## Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting ## any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may ## otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. ## ## 12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom. ## ## If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or ## otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not ## excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a ## covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this ## License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may ## not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you ## to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey ## the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this ## License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. ## ## 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. ## ## Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have ## permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed ## under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single ## combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this ## License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, ## but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, ## section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the ## combination as such. ## ## 14. Revised Versions of this License. ## ## The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of ## the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will ## be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to ## address new problems or concerns. ## ## Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the ## Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General ## Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the ## option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered ## version or of any later version published by the Free Software ## Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the ## GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published ## by the Free Software Foundation. ## ## If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future ## versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s ## public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you ## to choose that version for the Program. ## ## Later license versions may give you additional or different ## permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any ## author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a ## later version. ## ## 15. Disclaimer of Warranty. ## ## THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY ## APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT ## HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY ## OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ## THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR ## PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM ## IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ## ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. ## ## 16. Limitation of Liability. ## ## IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING ## WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS ## THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY ## GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE ## USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF ## DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD ## PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), ## EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ## SUCH DAMAGES. ## ## 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. ## ## If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided ## above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, ## reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates ## an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the ## Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a ## copy of the Program in return for a fee. ## ## END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS ## ## How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs ## ## If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest ## possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it ## free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. ## ## To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest ## to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively ## state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least ## the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. ## ## &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt; ## Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt; ## ## This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify ## it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by ## the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or ## (at your option) any later version. ## ## This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, ## but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of ## MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the ## GNU General Public License for more details. ## ## You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License ## along with this program. If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;. ## ## Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. ## ## If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short ## notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: ## ## &lt;program&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt; ## This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;. ## This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it ## under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details. ## ## The hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate ## parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program&#39;s commands ## might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an &quot;about box&quot;. ## ## You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, ## if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary. ## For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see ## &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;. ## ## The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program ## into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you ## may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with ## the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General ## Public License instead of this License. But first, please read ## &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;. 7.7 The “GNU Library General Public License” version 2 ## GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE ## Version 2, June 1991 ## ## Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. ## 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA ## Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies ## of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. ## ## [This is the first released version of the library GPL. It is ## numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.] ## ## Preamble ## ## The licenses for most software are designed to take away your ## freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public ## Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change ## free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. ## ## This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some ## specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any ## other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for ## your libraries, too. ## ## When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not ## price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you ## have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for ## this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it ## if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it ## in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. ## ## To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid ## anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. ## These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if ## you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it. ## ## For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis ## or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave ## you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source ## code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide ## complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them ## with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling ## it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. ## ## Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright ## the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal ## permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. ## ## Also, for each distributor&#39;s protection, we want to make certain ## that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free ## library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we ## want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original ## version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on ## the original authors&#39; reputations. ## ## Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software ## patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free ## software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect ## transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, ## we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s ## free use or not licensed at all. ## ## Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary ## GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This ## license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain ## designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary ## one; be sure to read it in full, and don&#39;t assume that anything in it is ## the same as in the ordinary license. ## ## The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that ## they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a ## program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without ## changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is ## analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in ## a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a ## derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License ## treats it as such. ## ## Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General ## Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software ## sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We ## concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better. ## ## However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the ## users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the ## libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to ## permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while ## preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free ## libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve ## this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards ## changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this ## will lead to faster development of free libraries. ## ## The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and ## modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a ## &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The ## former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only ## works together with the library. ## ## Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary ## General Public License rather than by this special one. ## ## GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE ## TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION ## ## 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which ## contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized ## party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library ## General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is ## addressed as &quot;you&quot;. ## ## A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data ## prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs ## (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. ## ## The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work ## which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the ## Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under ## copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a ## portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated ## straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is ## included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) ## ## &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for ## making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means ## all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated ## interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation ## and installation of the library. ## ## Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not ## covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of ## running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from ## such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based ## on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for ## writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does ## and what the program that uses the Library does. ## ## 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s ## complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that ## you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an ## appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact ## all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any ## warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the ## Library. ## ## You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, ## and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a ## fee. ## ## 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion ## of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and ## distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 ## above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: ## ## a) The modified work must itself be a software library. ## ## b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices ## stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. ## ## c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no ## charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. ## ## d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a ## table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses ## the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility ## is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, ## in the event an application does not supply such function or ## table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of ## its purpose remains meaningful. ## ## (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has ## a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the ## application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any ## application-supplied function or table used by this function must ## be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square ## root function must still compute square roots.) ## ## These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If ## identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, ## and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in ## themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those ## sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you ## distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based ## on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of ## this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the ## entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote ## it. ## ## Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest ## your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to ## exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or ## collective works based on the Library. ## ## In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library ## with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of ## a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under ## the scope of this License. ## ## 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public ## License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do ## this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so ## that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, ## instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ## ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify ## that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in ## these notices. ## ## Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for ## that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all ## subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. ## ## This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of ## the Library into a program that is not a library. ## ## 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or ## derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form ## under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany ## it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which ## must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a ## medium customarily used for software interchange. ## ## If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy ## from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the ## source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to ## distribute the source code, even though third parties are not ## compelled to copy the source along with the object code. ## ## 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the ## Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or ## linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a ## work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and ## therefore falls outside the scope of this License. ## ## However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library ## creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it ## contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the ## library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. ## Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. ## ## When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file ## that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a ## derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. ## Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be ## linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The ## threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. ## ## If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data ## structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline ## functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object ## file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative ## work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the ## Library will still fall under Section 6.) ## ## Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may ## distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. ## Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, ## whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. ## ## 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or ## link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a ## work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work ## under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit ## modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse ## engineering for debugging such modifications. ## ## You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the ## Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by ## this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work ## during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the ## copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference ## directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one ## of these things: ## ## a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding ## machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever ## changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under ## Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked ## with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that ## uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the ## user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified ## executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood ## that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the ## Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application ## to use the modified definitions.) ## ## b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at ## least three years, to give the same user the materials ## specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more ## than the cost of performing this distribution. ## ## c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy ## from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above ## specified materials from the same place. ## ## d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these ## materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. ## ## For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the ## Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for ## reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, ## the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally ## distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major ## components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on ## which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies ## the executable. ## ## It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license ## restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally ## accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot ## use both them and the Library together in an executable that you ## distribute. ## ## 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the ## Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library ## facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined ## library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on ## the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise ## permitted, and provided that you do these two things: ## ## a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work ## based on the Library, uncombined with any other library ## facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the ## Sections above. ## ## b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact ## that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining ## where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. ## ## 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute ## the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any ## attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or ## distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your ## rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, ## or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses ## terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. ## ## 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not ## signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or ## distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are ## prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by ## modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the ## Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and ## all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying ## the Library or works based on it. ## ## 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the ## Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the ## original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library ## subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further ## restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein. ## You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to ## this License. ## ## 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent ## infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), ## conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or ## otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not ## excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot ## distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this ## License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you ## may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent ## license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by ## all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then ## the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to ## refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. ## ## If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any ## particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, ## and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. ## ## It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any ## patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any ## such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the ## integrity of the free software distribution system which is ## implemented by public license practices. Many people have made ## generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed ## through that system in reliance on consistent application of that ## system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing ## to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot ## impose that choice. ## ## This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to ## be a consequence of the rest of this License. ## ## 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in ## certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the ## original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add ## an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, ## so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus ## excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if ## written in the body of this License. ## ## 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new ## versions of the Library General Public License from time to time. ## Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, ## but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. ## ## Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library ## specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ## &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and ## conditions either of that version or of any later version published by ## the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a ## license version number, you may choose any version ever published by ## the Free Software Foundation. ## ## 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free ## programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, ## write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is ## copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free ## Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our ## decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status ## of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing ## and reuse of software generally. ## ## NO WARRANTY ## ## 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO ## WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. ## EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR ## OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY ## KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE ## IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR ## PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE ## LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME ## THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. ## ## 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN ## WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY ## AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU ## FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR ## CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE ## LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING ## RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A ## FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF ## SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH ## DAMAGES. ## ## END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS ## ## How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries ## ## If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest ## possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that ## everyone can redistribute and change.

It is ## safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively ## convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the ## &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. ## ## &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt; ## Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt; ## ## This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or ## modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public ## License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either ## version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. ## ## This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, ## but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of ## MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It also counts ## as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence ## the version number 2.1.] ## ## Preamble ## ## The licenses for most software are designed to take away your ## freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public ## Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change ## free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. ## ## This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some ## specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the ## Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You ## can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether ## this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better ## strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. ## ## When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, ## not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that ## you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge ## for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get ## it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of ## it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do ## these things. ## ## To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid ## distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these ## rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for ## you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. ## ## For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis ## or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave ## you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source ## code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide ## complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them ## with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling ## it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. ## ## We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the ## library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal ## permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. ## ## To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that ## there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is ## modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know ## that what they have is not the original version, so that the original ## author&#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be ## introduced by others. ## ## Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of ## any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot ## effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a ## restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that ## any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be ## consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. ## ## Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ## ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser ## General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and ## is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use ## this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those ## libraries into non-free programs. ## ## When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using ## a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a ## combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary ## General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the ## entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General ## Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with ## the library. ## ## We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it ## does Less to protect the user&#39;s freedom than the ordinary General ## Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less ## of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages ## are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many ## libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain ## special circumstances. ## ## For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to ## encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes ## a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be ## allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free ## library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this ## case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free ## software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. ## ## In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free ## programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of ## free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in ## non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU ## operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating ## system. ## ## Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the ## users&#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is ## linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run ## that program using a modified version of the Library. ## ## The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and ## modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a ## &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The ## former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must ## be combined with the library in order to run. ## ## GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE ## TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION ## ## 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other ## program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or ## other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of ## this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;). ## Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. ## ## A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data ## prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs ## (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. ## ## The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work ## which has been distributed under these terms.

A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a ## copy of the library already present on the user&#39;s computer system, ## rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) ## will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if ## the user installs one, as long as the modified version is ## interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. ## ## c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at ## least three years, to give the same user the materials ## specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more ## than the cost of performing this distribution. ## ## d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy ## from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above ## specified materials from the same place. ## ## e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these ## materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. ## ## For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the ## Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for ## reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, ## the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is ## normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major ## components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on ## which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies ## the executable. ## ## It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license ## restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally ## accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot ## use both them and the Library together in an executable that you ## distribute. ## ## 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the ## Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library ## facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined ## library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on ## the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise ## permitted, and provided that you do these two things: ## ## a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work ## based on the Library, uncombined with any other library ## facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the ## Sections above. ## ## b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact ## that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining ## where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. ## ## 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute ## the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any ## attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or ## distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your ## rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, ## or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses ## terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. ## ## 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not ## signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or ## distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are ## prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by ## modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the ## Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and ## all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying ## the Library or works based on it. ## ## 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the ## Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the ## original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library ## subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further ## restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein. ## You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with ## this License. ## ## 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent ## infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), ## conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or ## otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not ## excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot ## distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this ## License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you ## may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent ## license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by ## all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then ## the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to ## refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. ## ## If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any ## particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, ## and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. ## ## It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any ## patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any ## such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the ## integrity of the free software distribution system which is ## implemented by public license practices. Many people have made ## generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed ## through that system in reliance on consistent application of that ## system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing ## to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot ## impose that choice. ## ## This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to ## be a consequence of the rest of this License. ## ## 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in ## certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the ## original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add ## an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, ## so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus ## excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if ## written in the body of this License. ## ## 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new ## versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. ## Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, ## but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. ## ## Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library ## specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ## &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and ## conditions either of that version or of any later version published by ## the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a ## license version number, you may choose any version ever published by ## the Free Software Foundation. ## ## 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free ## programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, ## write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is ## copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free ## Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our ## decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status ## of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing ## and reuse of software generally. ## ## NO WARRANTY ## ## 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO ## WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. ## EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR ## OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY ## KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE ## IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR ## PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE ## LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME ## THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. ## ## 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN ## WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY ## AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU ## FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR ## CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE ## LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING ## RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A ## FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF ## SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH ## DAMAGES. ## ## END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS ## ## How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries ## ## If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest ## possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that ## everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting ## redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ## ordinary General Public License). ## ## To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is ## safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively ## convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the ## &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. ## ## &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt; ## Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt; ## ## This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or ## modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public ## License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either ## version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. ## ## This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, ## but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of ## MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU ## Lesser General Public License for more details. ## ## You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public ## License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software ## Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA ## ## Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. ## ## You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your ## school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if ## necessary.

Additional Definitions. ## ## As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser ## General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU ## General Public License. ## ## &quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License, ## other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below. ## ## An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided ## by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. ## Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode ## of using an interface provided by the Library. ## ## A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an ## Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library ## with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked ## Version&quot;. ## ## The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the ## Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code ## for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are ## based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version. ## ## The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the ## object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data ## and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the ## Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work. ## ## 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL. ## ## You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License ## without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL. ## ## 2. Conveying Modified Versions. ## ## If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a ## facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application ## that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the ## facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified ## version: ## ## a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ## ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the ## function or data, the facility still operates, and performs ## whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or ## ## b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of ## this License applicable to that copy. ## ## 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files. ## ## The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from ## a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object ## code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated ## material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure ## layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates ## (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following: ## ## a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the ## Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are ## covered by this License. ## ## b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license ## document. ## ## 4. Combined Works. ## ## You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, ## taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the ## portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse ## engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of ## the following: ## ## a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that ## the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are ## covered by this License. ## ## b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license ## document. ## ## c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during ## execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among ## these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the ## copies of the GNU GPL and this license document. ## ## d) Do one of the following: ## ## 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this ## License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form ## suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to ## recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of ## the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the ## manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying ## Corresponding Source. ## ## 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the ## Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time ## a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer ## system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version ## of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked ## Version. ## ## e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise ## be required to provide such information under section 6 of the ## GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is ## necessary to install and execute a modified version of the ## Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the ## Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If ## you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany ## the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application ## Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation ## Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL ## for conveying Corresponding Source.) ## ## 5. Combined Libraries. ## ## You may place library facilities that are a work based on the ## Library side by side in a single library together with other library ## facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this ## License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your ## choice, if you do both of the following: ## ## a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based ## on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, ## conveyed under the terms of this License. ## ## b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it ## is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the ## accompanying uncombined form of the same work. ## ## 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License. ## ## The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions ## of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new ## versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may ## differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. ## ## Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the ## Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version ## of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; ## applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and ## conditions either of that published version or of any later version ## published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you ## received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser ## General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser ## General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation. ## ## If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide ## whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall ## apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is ## permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the ## Library. 7.10 The “MIT License” ## Based on &lt;http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT&gt; ## ## This is a template.

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a ## contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your ## acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You ## such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from ## making the Licensed Material available under these terms and ## conditions. ## ## ## Section 1 -- Definitions. ## ## a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar ## Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material ## and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, ## arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring ## permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the ## Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed ## Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, ## Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is ## synched in timed relation with a moving image. ## ## b. Adapter&#39;s License means the license You apply to Your Copyright ## and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in ## accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License. ## ## c. BY-SA Compatible License means a license listed at ## creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative ## Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License. ## ## d. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights ## closely related to copyright including, without limitation, ## performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database ## Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or ## categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights ## specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar ## Rights. ## ## e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the ## absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws ## fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright ## Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international ## agreements. ## ## f. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or ## any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights ## that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material. ## ## g. License Elements means the license attributes listed in the name ## of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this ## Public License are Attribution and ShareAlike. ## ## h. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, ## or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public ## License. ## ## i. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the ## terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to ## all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the ## Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license. ## ## j. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights ## under this Public License. ## ## k. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or ## process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such ## as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, ## dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material ## available to the public including in ways that members of the ## public may access the material from a place and at a time ## individually chosen by them. ## ## l. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright ## resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of ## the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, ## as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially ## equivalent rights anywhere in the world. ## ## m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights ## under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning. ## ## ## Section 2 -- Scope. ## ## a. License grant. ## ## 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, ## the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, ## non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to ## exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: ## ## a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or ## in part; and ## ## b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material. ## ## 2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where ## Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public ## License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with ## its terms and conditions. ## ## 3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section ## 6(a). ## ## 4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The ## Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in ## all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, ## and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The ## Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or ## authority to forbid You from making technical modifications ## necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including ## technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective ## Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, ## simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a) ## (4) never produces Adapted Material. ## ## 5. Downstream recipients. ## ## a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every ## recipient of the Licensed Material automatically ## receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the ## Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this ## Public License. ## ## b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material. ## Every recipient of Adapted Material from You ## automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to ## exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material ## under the conditions of the Adapter&#39;s License You apply. ## ## c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose ## any additional or different terms or conditions on, or ## apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the ## Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the ## Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed ## Material. ## ## 6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or ## may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You ## are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected ## with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, ## the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as ## provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i). ## ## b. Other rights. ## ## 1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not ## licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, ## privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to ## the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to ## assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited ## extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed ## Rights, but not otherwise. ## ## 2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this ## Public License. ## ## 3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to ## collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed ## Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society ## under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory ## licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly ## reserves any right to collect such royalties. ## ## ## Section 3 -- License Conditions. ## ## Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the ## following conditions. ## ## a. Attribution. ## ## 1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified ## form), You must: ## ## a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor ## with the Licensed Material: ## ## i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed ## Material and any others designated to receive ## attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by ## the Licensor (including by pseudonym if ## designated); ## ## ii. a copyright notice; ## ## iii. a notice that refers to this Public License; ## ## iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of ## warranties; ## ## v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the ## extent reasonably practicable; ## ## b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and ## retain an indication of any previous modifications; and ## ## c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this ## Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or ## hyperlink to, this Public License. ## ## 2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any ## reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in ## which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be ## reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or ## hyperlink to a resource that includes the required ## information. ## ## 3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the ## information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent ## reasonably practicable. ## ## b. ShareAlike. ## ## In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share ## Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply. ## ## 1. The Adapter&#39;s License You apply must be a Creative Commons ## license with the same License Elements, this version or ## later, or a BY-SA Compatible License. ## ## 2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the ## Adapter&#39;s License You apply. You may satisfy this condition ## in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and ## context in which You Share Adapted Material. ## ## 3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms ## or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological ## Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the ## rights granted under the Adapter&#39;s License You apply. ## ## ## Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights. ## ## Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that ## apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: ## ## a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right ## to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial ## portion of the contents of the database; ## ## b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database ## contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database ## Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database ## Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, ## ## including for purposes of Section 3(b); and ## c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share ## all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. ## ## For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not ## replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed ## Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. ## ## ## Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. ## ## a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE ## EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS ## AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ## ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS, ## IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ## WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR ## PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ## ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT ## KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT ## ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. ## ## b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE ## TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ## NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, ## INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, ## COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR ## USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ## ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR ## DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR ## IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. ## ## c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided ## above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent ## possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and ## waiver of all liability. ## ## ## Section 6 -- Term and Termination. ## ## a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and ## Similar Rights licensed here.
