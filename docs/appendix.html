<pre><code>##                     GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
##                        Version 3, 19 November 2007
## 
##  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;
##  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
##  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
## 
##                             Preamble
## 
##   The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
## software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
## cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
## 
##   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
## to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
## our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
## share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
## software for all its users.
## 
##   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
## price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
## have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
## them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
## want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
## free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
## 
##   Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
## with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
## you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
## and/or modify the software.
## 
##   A secondary benefit of defending all users&#39; freedom is that
## improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
## receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
## incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
## encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
## software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
## The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
## letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
## source code to the public.
## 
##   The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
## ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
## to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
## provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
## users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
## a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
## code of the modified version.
## 
##   An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
## published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
## a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
## released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
## this license.
## 
##   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and

##                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
## 
##   0. Definitions.
## 
##   &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
## 
##   &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
## works, such as semiconductor masks.
## 
##   &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
## License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and
## &quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.
## 
##   To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
## in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
## exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the
## earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.
## 
##   A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
## on the Program.
## 
##   To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
## permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
## infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
## computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
## distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
## public, and in some countries other activities as well.
## 
##   To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
## parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
## a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
## 
##   An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;
## to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
## feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
## tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
## extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
## work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
## the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
## menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
## 
##   1. Source Code.
## 
##   The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work
## for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source
## form of a work.
## 
##   A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official
## standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
## interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
## is widely used among developers working in that language.
## 
##   The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other
## than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
## packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
## Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
## Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
## implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
## &quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component
## (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
## (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
## produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
## 
##   The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all
## the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
## work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
## control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&#39;s
## System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
## programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
## which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
## includes interface definition files associated with source files for
## the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
## linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
## such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
## subprograms and other parts of the work.
## 
##   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
## can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
## Source.
## 
##   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
## same work.
## 
##   2. Basic Permissions.
## 
##   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
## copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
## conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
## permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
## covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
## content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
## rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
## 
##   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
## convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
## in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
## of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
## with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
## the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
## not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
## for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
## and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
## your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
## 
##   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
## the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
## makes it unnecessary.
## 
##   3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
## 
##   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
## measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
## 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
## similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
## measures.
## 
##   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
## circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
## is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
## the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
## modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s
## users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of
## technological measures.
## 
##   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
## 
##   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you
## receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
## appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
## keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
## non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
## keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
## recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
## 
##   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
## and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
## 
##   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
## 
##   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
## produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
## terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
## 
##     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
##     it, and giving a relevant date.
## 
##     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
##     released under this License and any conditions added under section
##     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
##     &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.
## 
##     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
##     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
##     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
##     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
##     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
##     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
##     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
## 
##     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
##     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
##     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
##     work need not make them do so.
## 
##   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
## works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
## and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
## in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
## &quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
## used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users
## beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
## in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
## parts of the aggregate.
## 
##   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
## 
##   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
## of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
## machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
## in one of these ways:
## 
##     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
##     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
##     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
##     customarily used for software interchange.
## 
##     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
##     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
##     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
##     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
##     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
##     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
##     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
##     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
##     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
##     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
##     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
## 
##     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
##     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
##     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
##     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
##     with subsection 6b.
## 
##     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
##     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
##     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
##     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
##     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
##     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
##     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
##     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
##     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
##     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
##     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
##     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
## 
##     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
##     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
##     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
##     charge under subsection 6d.
## 
##   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
## from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
## included in conveying the object code work.
## 
##   A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any
## tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
## or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
## into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
## doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
## product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a
## typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
## of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
## actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
## is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
## commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
## the only significant mode of use of the product.
## 
##   &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,
## procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
## and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
## a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
## suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
## code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
## modification has been made.
## 
##   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
## specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
## part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
## User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
## fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
## Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
## by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
## if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
## modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
## been installed in ROM).
## 
##   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
## requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
## for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
## the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
## network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
## adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
## protocols for communication across the network.
## 
##   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
## in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
## documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
## source code form), and must require no special password or key for
## unpacking, reading or copying.
## 
##   7. Additional Terms.
## 
##   &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this
## License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
## Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
## be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
## that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
## apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
## under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
## this License without regard to the additional permissions.
## 
##   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
## remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
## it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
## removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
## additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
## for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
## add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
## that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
## 
##     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
##     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
## 
##     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
##     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
##     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
## 
##     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
##     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
##     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
## 
##     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
##     authors of the material; or
## 
##     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
##     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
## 
##     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
##     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
##     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
##     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
##     those licensors and authors.
## 
##   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further
## restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
## received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
## governed by this License along with a term that is a further
## restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
## a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
## License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
## of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
## not survive such relicensing or conveying.
## 
##   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
## must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
## additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
## where to find the applicable terms.
## 
##   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
## form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
## the above requirements apply either way.
## 
##   8. Termination.
## 
##   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
## provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
## modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
## this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
## paragraph of section 11).
## 
##   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
## license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
## provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
## finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
## holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
## prior to 60 days after the cessation.
## 
##   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
## reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
## violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
## received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
## copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
## your receipt of the notice.
## 
##   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
## licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
## this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
## reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
## material under section 10.
## 
##   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
## 
##   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
## run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
## occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
## to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
## nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
## modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
## not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
## covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
## 
##   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
## 
##   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
## receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
## propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
## for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
## 
##   An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an
## organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
## organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
## work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
## transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
## licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could
## give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
## Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
## the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
## 
##   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
## rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
## not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
## rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
## (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
## any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
## sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
## 
##   11. Patents.
## 
##   A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
## License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
## work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.
## 
##   A contributor&#39;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims
## owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
## hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
## by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
## but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
## consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
## purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant
## patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
## this License.
## 
##   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
## patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to
## make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
## propagate the contents of its contributor version.
## 
##   In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express
## agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
## (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
## sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a
## party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
## patent against the party.
## 
##   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
## and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
## to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
## publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
## then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
## available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
## patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
## consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
## license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have
## actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
## covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work
## in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
## country that you have reason to believe are valid.
## 
##   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
## arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
## covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
## receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
## or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
## you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
## work and works based on it.
## 
##   A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within
## the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
## conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
## specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
## work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
## in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
## to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
## the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
## parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
## patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
## conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
## for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
## contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
## or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
## 
##   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
## any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
## otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
## 
##   12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.
## 
##   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
## otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
## excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
## covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
## License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
## not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
## to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
## the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
## License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
## 
##   13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
## Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
## interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
## supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
## Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
## from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
## means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
## shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
## of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
## following paragraph.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
## permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
## under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
## combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
## License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
## but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
## 3 of the GNU General Public License.
## 
##   14. Revised Versions of this License.
## 
##   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
## the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
## will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
## address new problems or concerns.
## 
##   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
## Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
## Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the
## option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
## version or of any later version published by the Free Software
## Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
## GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
## by the Free Software Foundation.
## 
##   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
## versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s
## public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
## to choose that version for the Program.
## 
##   Later license versions may give you additional or different
## permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
## author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
## later version.
## 
##   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
## 
##   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
## APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
## HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY
## OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
## THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
## PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
## IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
## ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
## 
##   16. Limitation of Liability.
## 
##   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
## WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
## THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
## GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
## USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
## DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
## PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
## EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
## SUCH DAMAGES.
## 
##   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
## 
##   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
## above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
## reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
## an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
## Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
## copy of the Program in return for a fee.
## 
##                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
## 
##             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
## 
##   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
## possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
## free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
## 
##   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
## to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
## state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
## the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
## 
##     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> The “Artistic License” version 2.0</h2>
<pre><code>## Artistic License 2.0
## 
## Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.
## 
## Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
## license document, but changing it is not allowed.
## 
## Preamble
## ********
## 
## This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
## Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.  The
## intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over
## the development of that Package while still keeping the Package
## available as open source and free software.
## 
## You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
## license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
## terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
## make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a
## different licensing arrangement.
## 
## Definitions
## ***********
## 
## &quot;Copyright Holder&quot; means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in
## the copyright notice for the entire Package.
## 
## &quot;Contributor&quot; means any party that has contributed code or other
## material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder&#39;s
## procedures.
## 
## &quot;You&quot; and &quot;your&quot; means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or
## modify the Package.
## 
## &quot;Package&quot; means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
## Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files.  A
## given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified
## Version.
## 
## &quot;Distribute&quot; means providing a copy of the Package or making it
## accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization,
## to others outside of your company or organization.
## 
## &quot;Distributor Fee&quot; means any fee that you charge for Distributing this
## Package or providing support for this Package to another party.  It does
## not mean licensing fees.
## 
## &quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or
## has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright
## Holder.
## 
## &quot;Modified Version&quot; means the Package, if it has been changed, and such
## changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.
## 
## &quot;Original License&quot; means this Artistic License as Distributed with the
## Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be
## modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
## 
## &quot;Source&quot; form means the source code, documentation source, and
## configuration files for the Package.
## 
## &quot;Compiled&quot; form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any
## other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of
## the Source form.
## 
## Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
## ********************************************************
## 
## (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
## Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you
## do not Distribute the Modified Version.
## 
## Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
## ******************************************************
## 
## (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
## Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
## either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all
## of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At your
## discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form
## of the Package.
## 
## (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
## modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
## Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will
## be subject to the Original License.
## 
## Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
## **********************************************************
## 
## (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or
## for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
## Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from
## the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any
## non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do
## at least ONE of the following:
## 
## (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the
## Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright
## Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.
## 
## (b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent
## the user installing or running the Standard Version.  In addition, the
## Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the
## Standard Version.
## 
## (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the
## Source form of the Modified Version available to others under
## 
## (i) the Original License or
## 
## (ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and
## redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that
## apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the
## Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it,
## be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but
## Distributor Fees are allowed.
## 
## Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified
## ******************************************************************
## Versions without the Source
## ***************************
## 
## (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
## the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
## get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be valid
## at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any time
## while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must
## provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.  If
## you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days
## after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do
## not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
## 
## (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the
## Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the
## Source of the Modified Version.
## 
## Aggregating or Linking the Package
## **********************************
## 
## (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
## Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
## aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
## Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
## components in the aggregation are permitted.  The terms of this license
## apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
## as included in the aggregation.
## 
## (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other
## works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build
## stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the
## Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the
## result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
## 
## Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
## ********************************************************
## 
## (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
## merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
## the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
## considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms
## of this license.
## 
## General Provisions
## ******************
## 
## (10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified
## Versions is governed by this Artistic License.  By using, modifying or
## distributing the Package, you accept this license.  Do not use, modify,
## or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.
## 
## (11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version
## made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure
## that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this
## license.
## 
## (12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
## service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
## 
## (13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge
## patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and
## otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims
## licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the
## Package.  If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or
## counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes
## direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License
## to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.
## 
## (14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT
## HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS &quot;AS IS&#39; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
## WARRANTIES.  THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
## PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT

<pre><code>##                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
##                        Version 2, June 1991
## 
##  Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
##  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
##  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
##  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
## 
##                             Preamble
## 
##   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
## freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
## License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
## software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
## General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
## Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to
## using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
## the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
## your programs, too.
## 
##   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
## price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
## have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
## this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
## if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
## in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
## 
##   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
## anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
## These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
## distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
## 
##   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
## gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
## you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
## source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
## rights.
## 
##   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
## (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
## distribute and/or modify the software.
## 
##   Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain
## that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
## software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
## want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
## that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
## authors&#39; reputations.
## 
##   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
## patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
## program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
## program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
## patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all.
## 
##   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
## modification follow.
## 
##                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
##    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
## 
##   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
## a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
## under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,
## refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;
## means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
## that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
## either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
## language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
## the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
## 
## Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
## covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
## running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
## is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
## Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
## Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
## 
##   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s
## source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
## conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
## copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
## notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
## and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
## along with the Program.
## 
## You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
## you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
## 
##   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
## of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
## distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
## above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
## 
##     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
##     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
## 
##     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
##     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
##     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
##     parties under the terms of this License.
## 
##     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
##     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
##     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
##     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
##     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
##     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
##     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
##     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
##     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
##     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
## 
## These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
## identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
## and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
## themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
## sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
## distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
## on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
## this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
## entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
## 
## Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
## your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
## exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
## collective works based on the Program.
## 
## In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
## with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
## a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
## the scope of this License.
## 
##   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
## under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
## Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
## 
##     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
##     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
##     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
## 
##     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
##     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
##     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
##     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
##     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
##     customarily used for software interchange; or,
## 
##     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
##     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
##     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
##     received the program in object code or executable form with such
##     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
## 
## The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
## making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
## code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
## associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
## control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
## special exception, the source code distributed need not include
## anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
## form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
## operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
## itself accompanies the executable.
## 
## If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
## access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
## access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
## distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
## compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
## 
##   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
## except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
## otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
## void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
## However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
## this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
## parties remain in full compliance.
## 
##   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
## signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
## distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
## prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
## modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
## Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
## all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
## the Program or works based on it.
## 
##   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
## Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
## original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
## these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
## restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.
## You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
## this License.
## 
##   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
## infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
## conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
## otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
## excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
## distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
## License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
## may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
## license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
## all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
## the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
## refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
## 
## If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
## any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
## apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
## circumstances.
## 
## It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
## patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
## such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
## integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
## implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
## generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
## through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
## system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
## to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
## impose that choice.
## 
## This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
## be a consequence of the rest of this License.
## 
##   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
## certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
## original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
## may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
## those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
## countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
## the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
## 
##   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
## of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
## be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
## address new problems or concerns.
## 
## Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
## specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
## later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
## either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
## Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
## this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
## Foundation.
## 
##   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
## programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
## to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
## Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
## make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
## of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
## of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
## 
##                             NO WARRANTY
## 
##   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
## FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN

##             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
## 
##   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
## possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
## free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
## 
##   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
## to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
## convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
## the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
## 
##     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
##     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
## 
##     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
##     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
##     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
##     (at your option) any later version.
## 
##     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
##     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
##     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
##     GNU General Public License for more details.
## 
##     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
##     with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
##     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
## 
## Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
## 
## If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
## when it starts in an interactive mode:
## 
##     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
##     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.
##     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
##     under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.
## 
## The hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate
## parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
## be called something other than `show w&#39; and `show c&#39;; they could even be
## mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
## 
## You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
## school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if
## necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
## 
##   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
##   `Gnomovision&#39; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

## 
## This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
## proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
## consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
## library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
## Public License instead of this License.</code></pre>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.6</span> The “GNU General Public License” version 3</h2>
<pre><code>##                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
##                        Version 3, 29 June 2007
## 
##  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;
##  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
##  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
## 
##                             Preamble
## 
##   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
## software and other kinds of works.
## 
##   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
## to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
## the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
## share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
## software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
## GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
## any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
## your programs, too.
## 
##   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
## price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
## have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
## them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
## want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
## free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
## 
##   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
## these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
## certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
## you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
## 
##   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
## gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
## freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
## or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
## know their rights.
## 
##   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
## (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
## giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
## 
##   For the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains
## that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&#39; and
## authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
## changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
## authors of previous versions.
## 
##   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
## modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
## can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
## protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software.  The systematic
## pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
## use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
## have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
## products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
## stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
## of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
## 
##   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
## States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
## software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
## avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
## make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
## patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
## 
##   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
## modification follow.
## 
##                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
## 
##   0. Definitions.
## 
##   &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
## 
##   &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
## works, such as semiconductor masks.
## 
##   &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
## License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and
## &quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.
## 
##   To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
## in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
## exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the
## earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.
## 
##   A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
## on the Program.
## 
##   To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
## permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
## infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
## computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
## distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
## public, and in some countries other activities as well.
## 
##   To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
## parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
## a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
## 
##   An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;
## to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
## feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
## tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
## extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
## work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
## the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
## menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
## 
##   1. Source Code.
## 
##   The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work
## for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source
## form of a work.
## 
##   A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official
## standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
## interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
## is widely used among developers working in that language.
## 
##   The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other
## than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
## packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
## Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
## Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
## implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
## &quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component
## (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
## (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
## produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
## 
##   The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all
## the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
## work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
## control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&#39;s
## System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
## programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
## which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
## includes interface definition files associated with source files for
## the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
## linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
## such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
## subprograms and other parts of the work.
## 
##   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
## can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
## Source.
## 
##   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
## same work.
## 
##   2. Basic Permissions.
## 
##   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
## copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
## conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
## permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
## covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
## content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
## rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
## 
##   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
## convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
## in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
## of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
## with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
## the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
## not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
## for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
## and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
## your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
## 
##   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
## the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
## makes it unnecessary.
## 
##   3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
## 
##   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
## measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
## 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
## similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
## measures.
## 
##   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
## circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
## is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
## the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
## modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s
## users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of
## technological measures.
## 
##   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
## 
##   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you
## receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
## appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
## keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
## non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
## keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
## recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
## 
##   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
## and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
## 
##   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
## 
##   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
## produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
## terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
## 
##     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
##     it, and giving a relevant date.
## 
##     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
##     released under this License and any conditions added under section
##     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
##     &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.
## 
##     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
##     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
##     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
##     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
##     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
##     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
##     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
## 
##     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
##     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
##     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
##     work need not make them do so.
## 
##   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
## works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
## and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
## in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
## &quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
## used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users
## beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
## in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
## parts of the aggregate.
## 
##   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
## 
##   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
## of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
## machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
## in one of these ways:
## 
##     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
##     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
##     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
##     customarily used for software interchange.
## 
##     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
##     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
##     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
##     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
##     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
##     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
##     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
##     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
##     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
##     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
##     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
## 
##     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
##     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
##     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
##     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
##     with subsection 6b.
## 
##     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
##     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
##     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
##     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
##     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
##     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
##     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
##     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
##     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
##     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
##     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
##     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
## 
##     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
##     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
##     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
##     charge under subsection 6d.
## 
##   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
## from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
## included in conveying the object code work.
## 
##   A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any
## tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
## or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
## into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
## doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
## product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a
## typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
## of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
## actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
## is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
## commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
## the only significant mode of use of the product.
## 
##   &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,
## procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
## and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
## a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
## suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
## code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
## modification has been made.
## 
##   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
## specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
## part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
## User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
## fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
## Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
## by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
## if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
## modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
## been installed in ROM).
## 
##   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
## requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
## for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
## the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
## network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
## adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
## protocols for communication across the network.
## 
##   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
## in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
## documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
## source code form), and must require no special password or key for
## unpacking, reading or copying.
## 
##   7. Additional Terms.
## 
##   &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this
## License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
## Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
## be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
## that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
## apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
## under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
## this License without regard to the additional permissions.
## 
##   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
## remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
## it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
## removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
## additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
## for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
## add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
## that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
## 
##     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
##     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
## 
##     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
##     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
##     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
## 
##     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
##     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
##     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
## 
##     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
##     authors of the material; or
## 
##     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
##     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
## 
##     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
##     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
##     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
##     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
##     those licensors and authors.
## 
##   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further
## restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
## received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
## governed by this License along with a term that is a further
## restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
## a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
## License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
## of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
## not survive such relicensing or conveying.
## 
##   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
## must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
## additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
## where to find the applicable terms.
## 
##   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
## form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
## the above requirements apply either way.
## 
##   8. Termination.
## 
##   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
## provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
## modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
## this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
## paragraph of section 11).
## 
##   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
## license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
## provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
## finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
## holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
## prior to 60 days after the cessation.
## 
##   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
## reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
## violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
## received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
## copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
## your receipt of the notice.
## 
##   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
## licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
## this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
## reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
## material under section 10.
## 
##   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
## 
##   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
## run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
## occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
## to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
## nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
## modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
## not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
## covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
## 
##   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
## 
##   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
## receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
## propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
## for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
## 
##   An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an
## organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
## organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
## work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
## transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
## licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could
## give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
## Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
## the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
## 
##   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
## rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
## not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
## rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
## (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
## any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
## sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
## 
##   11. Patents.
## 
##   A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
## License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
## work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.
## 
##   A contributor&#39;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims
## owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
## hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
## by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
## but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
## consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
## purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant
## patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
## this License.
## 
##   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
## patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to
## make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
## propagate the contents of its contributor version.
## 
##   In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express
## agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
## (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
## sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a
## party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
## patent against the party.
## 
##   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
## and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
## to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
## publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
## then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
## available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
## patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
## consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
## license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have
## actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
## covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work
## in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
## country that you have reason to believe are valid.
## 
##   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
## arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
## covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
## receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
## or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
## you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
## work and works based on it.
## 
##   A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within
## the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
## conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
## specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
## work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
## in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
## to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
## the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
## parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
## patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
## conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
## for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
## contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
## or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
## 
##   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
## any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
## otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
## 
##   12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.
## 
##   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
## otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
## excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
## covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
## License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
## not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
## to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
## the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
## License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
## 
##   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
## permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
## under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
## combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
## License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
## but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
## section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
## combination as such.
## 
##   14. Revised Versions of this License.
## 
##   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
## the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
## be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
## address new problems or concerns.
## 
##   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
## Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
## Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the
## option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
## version or of any later version published by the Free Software
## Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
## GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
## by the Free Software Foundation.
## 
##   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
## versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s
## public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
## to choose that version for the Program.
## 
##   Later license versions may give you additional or different
## permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
## author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
## later version.
## 
##   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
## 
##   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
## APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
## HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY
## OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
## THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
## PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
## IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
## ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
## 
##   16. Limitation of Liability.
## 
##   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
## WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
## THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
## GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
## USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
## DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
## PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
## EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
## SUCH DAMAGES.
## 
##   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
## 
##   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
## above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
## reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
## an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
## Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
## copy of the Program in return for a fee.
## 
##                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
## 
##             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
## 
##   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
## possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
## free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
## 
##   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
## to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
## state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
## the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
## 
##     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
##     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
## 
##     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
##     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
##     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
##     (at your option) any later version.
## 
##     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
##     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
##     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
##     GNU General Public License for more details.
## 
##     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
##     along with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
## 
## Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
## 
##   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
## notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
## 
##     &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
##     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.
##     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
##     under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.
## 
## The hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate
## parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program&#39;s commands
## might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an &quot;about box&quot;.
## 
##   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
## if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary.
## For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
## &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
## 
##   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
## into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
## may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
## the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
## Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
## &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.</code></pre>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.7</span> The “GNU Library General Public License” version 2</h2>
<pre><code>##        GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
##             Version 2, June 1991
## 
##  Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
##              51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301  USA
##  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
##  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
## 
## [This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
##  numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
## 
##              Preamble
## 
##   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
## freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
## Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
## free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
## 
##   This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
## specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
## other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
## your libraries, too.
## 
##   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
## price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
## have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
## this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
## if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
## in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
## 
##   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
## anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
## These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
## you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
## 
##   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
## or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
## you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
## code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
## complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
## with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
## it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
## 
##   Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
## the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
## permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
## 
##   Also, for each distributor&#39;s protection, we want to make certain
## that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
## library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
## want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
## version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
## the original authors&#39; reputations.
## 
##   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
## patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
## software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
## transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
## we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s
## free use or not licensed at all.
## 
##   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
## GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
## license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
## designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
## one; be sure to read it in full, and don&#39;t assume that anything in it is
## the same as in the ordinary license.
## 
##   The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
## they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
## program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
## changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
## analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
## a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
## derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
## treats it as such.
## 
##   Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
## Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
## sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
## concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
## 
##   However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
## users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
## libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
## permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
## preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
## libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
## this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
## changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
## will lead to faster development of free libraries.
## 
##   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
## modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
## &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The
## former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
## works together with the library.
## 
##   Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
## General Public License rather than by this special one.
## 
##        GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
##    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
## 
##   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
## contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
## party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
## General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).  Each licensee is
## addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
## 
##   A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data
## prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
## (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
## 
##   The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work
## which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the
## Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under
## copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
## portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
## straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
## included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)
## 
##   &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
## making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
## all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
## interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
## and installation of the library.
## 
##   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
## covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
## running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
## such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
## on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
## writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
## and what the program that uses the Library does.
##   
##   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s
## complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
## you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
## appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
## all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
## warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
## Library.
## 
##   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
## and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
## fee.
## 
##   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
## of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
## distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
## above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
## 
##     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
## 
##     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
##     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
## 
##     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
##     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
## 
##     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
##     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
##     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
##     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
##     in the event an application does not supply such function or
##     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
##     its purpose remains meaningful.
## 
##     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
##     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
##     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
##     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
##     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
##     root function must still compute square roots.)
## 
## These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
## identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
## and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
## themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
## sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
## distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
## on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
## this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
## entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
## it.
## 
## Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
## your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
## exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
## collective works based on the Library.
## 
## In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
## with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
## a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
## the scope of this License.
## 
##   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
## License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
## this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
## that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
## instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
## ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
## that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
## these notices.
## 
##   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
## that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
## subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
## 
##   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
## the Library into a program that is not a library.
## 
##   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
## derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
## under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
## it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
## must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
## medium customarily used for software interchange.
## 
##   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
## from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
## source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
## distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
## compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
## 
##   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
## Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
## linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a
## work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
## therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
## 
##   However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library
## creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
## contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the
## library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
## Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
## 
##   When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file
## that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
## derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
## Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
## linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
## threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
## 
##   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
## structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
## functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
## file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
## work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
## Library will still fall under Section 6.)
## 
##   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
## distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
## Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
## whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
## 
##   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
## link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a
## work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
## under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
## modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse
## engineering for debugging such modifications.
## 
##   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
## Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
## this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
## during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
## copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
## directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
## of these things:
## 
##     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
##     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
##     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
##     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
##     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that
##     uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the
##     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
##     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
##     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
##     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
##     to use the modified definitions.)
## 
##     b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
##     least three years, to give the same user the materials
##     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
##     than the cost of performing this distribution.
## 
##     c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
##     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
##     specified materials from the same place.
## 
##     d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
##     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
## 
##   For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the
## Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for
## reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
## the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
## distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
## components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
## which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
## the executable.
## 
##   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
## restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
## accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
## use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
## distribute.
## 
##   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
## Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
## facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
## library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
## the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
## permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
## 
##     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
##     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
##     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
##     Sections above.
## 
##     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
##     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
##     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
## 
##   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
## the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
## attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
## distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
## rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
## or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
## terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
## 
##   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
## signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
## distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
## prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
## modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
## Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
## all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
## the Library or works based on it.
## 
##   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
## Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
## original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
## subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
## restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.
## You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
## this License.
## 
##   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
## infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
## conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
## otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
## excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
## distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
## License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
## may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
## license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
## all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
## the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
## refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
## 
## If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
## particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
## and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
## 
## It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
## patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
## such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
## integrity of the free software distribution system which is
## implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
## generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
## through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
## system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
## to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
## impose that choice.
## 
## This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
## be a consequence of the rest of this License.
## 
##   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
## certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
## original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
## an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
## so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
## excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
## written in the body of this License.
## 
##   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
## versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
## Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
## but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
## 
## Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
## specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
## &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
## conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
## the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
## license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
## the Free Software Foundation.
## 
##   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
## programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
## write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
## copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
## Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
## decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
## of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
## and reuse of software generally.
## 
##              NO WARRANTY
## 
##   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
## WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
## EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
## OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
## KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
## IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
## PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
## LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
## THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
## 
##   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
## WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
## AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
## FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
## CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
## LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
## RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
## FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
## SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
## DAMAGES.
## 
##           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
## 
##            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
## 
##   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
## possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
## everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
## redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
## ordinary General Public License).
## 
##   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
## safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
## convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
## &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
## 
##     &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
##     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
## 
##     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
##     modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
##     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
##     version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
## 
##     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
##     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
##     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
##     Library General Public License for more details.
## 
##     You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
##     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
##     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301  USA
## 
## Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
## 
## You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
## school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if
## necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
## 
##   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the

<pre><code>##                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
##                        Version 2.1, February 1999
## 
##  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
##  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
##  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
##  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
## 
## [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
##  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
##  the version number 2.1.]
## 
##                             Preamble
## 
##   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
## freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
## Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
## free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
## 
##   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
## specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
## Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
## can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
## this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
## strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
## 
##   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
## not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
## you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
## for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
## it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
## it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
## these things.
## 
##   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
## distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
## rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
## you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
## 
##   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
## or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
## you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
## code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
## complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
## with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
## it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
## 
##   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
## library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
## permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
## 
##   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
## there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
## modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
## that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
## author&#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
## introduced by others.
## 
##   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
## any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
## effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
## restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
## any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
## consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
## 
##   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
## ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
## General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
## is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
## this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
## libraries into non-free programs.
## 
##   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
## a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
## combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
## General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
## entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
## Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
## the library.
## 
##   We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it
## does Less to protect the user&#39;s freedom than the ordinary General
## Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
## of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
## are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
## libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
## special circumstances.
## 
##   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
## encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
## a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
## allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
## library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
## case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
## software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
## 
##   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
## programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
## free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
## non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
## operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
## system.
## 
##   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
## users&#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
## linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
## that program using a modified version of the Library.
## 
##   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
## modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
## &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The
## former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
## be combined with the library in order to run.
## 
##                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
##    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
## 
##   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
## program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
## other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
## this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).
## Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
## 
##   A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data
## prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
## (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
## 
##   The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work
## which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the
## Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under
## copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
## portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
## straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
## included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)
## 
##   &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
## making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
## all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
## interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
## and installation of the library.
## 
##   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
## covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
## running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
## such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
## on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
## writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
## and what the program that uses the Library does.
## 
##   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s
## complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
## you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
## appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
## all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
## warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
## Library.
## 
##   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
## and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
## fee.
## 
##   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
## of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
## distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
## above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
## 
##     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
## 
##     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
##     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
## 
##     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
##     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
## 
##     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
##     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
##     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
##     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
##     in the event an application does not supply such function or
##     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
##     its purpose remains meaningful.
## 
##     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
##     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
##     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
##     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
##     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
##     root function must still compute square roots.)
## 
## These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
## identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
## and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
## themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
## sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
## distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
## on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
## this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
## entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
## it.
## 
## Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
## your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
## exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
## collective works based on the Library.
## 
## In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
## with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
## a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
## the scope of this License.
## 
##   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
## License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
## this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
## that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
## instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
## ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
## that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
## these notices.
## 
##   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
## that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
## subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
## 
##   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
## the Library into a program that is not a library.
## 
##   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
## derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
## under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
## it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
## must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
## medium customarily used for software interchange.
## 
##   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
## from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
## source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
## distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
## compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
## 
##   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
## Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
## linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a
## work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
## therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
## 
##   However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library
## creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
## contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the
## library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
## Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
## 
##   When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file
## that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
## derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
## Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
## linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
## threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
## 
##   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
## structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
## functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
## file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
## work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
## Library will still fall under Section 6.)
## 
##   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
## distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
## Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
## whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
## 
##   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
## link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a
## work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
## under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
## modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse
## engineering for debugging such modifications.
## 
##   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
## Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
## this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
## during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
## copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
## directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
## of these things:
## 
##     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
##     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
##     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
##     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
##     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that
##     uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the
##     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
##     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
##     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
##     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
##     to use the modified definitions.)
## 
##     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
##     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
##     copy of the library already present on the user&#39;s computer system,
##     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
##     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
##     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
##     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
## 
##     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
##     least three years, to give the same user the materials
##     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
##     than the cost of performing this distribution.
## 
##     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
##     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
##     specified materials from the same place.
## 
##     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
##     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
## 
##   For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the
## Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for
## reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
## the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
## normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
## components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
## which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
## the executable.
## 
##   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
## restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
## accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
## use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
## distribute.
## 
##   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
## Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
## facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
## library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
## the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
## permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
## 
##     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
##     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
##     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
##     Sections above.
## 
##     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
##     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
##     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
## 
##   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
## the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
## attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
## distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
## rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
## or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
## terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
## 
##   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
## signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
## distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
## prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
## modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
## Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
## all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
## the Library or works based on it.
## 
##   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
## Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
## original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
## subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
## restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.
## You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
## this License.
## 
##   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
## infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
## conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
## otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
## excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
## distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
## License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
## may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
## license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
## all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
## the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
## refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
## 
## If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
## particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
## and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
## 
## It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
## patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
## such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
## integrity of the free software distribution system which is
## implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
## generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
## through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
## system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
## to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
## impose that choice.
## 
## This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
## be a consequence of the rest of this License.
## 
##   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
## certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
## original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
## an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
## so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
## excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
## written in the body of this License.
## 
##   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
## versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
## Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
## but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
## 
## Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
## specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
## &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
## conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
## the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
## license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
## the Free Software Foundation.
## 
##   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
## programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
## write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
## copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
## Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
## decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
## of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
## and reuse of software generally.
## 
##                             NO WARRANTY
## 
##   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
## WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
## EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
## OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
## KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
## IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
## PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
## LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
## THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
## 
##   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
## WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
## AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
## FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
## CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
## LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
## RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
## FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
## SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
## DAMAGES.
## 
##                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
## 
##            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
## 
##   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
## possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
## everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
## redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
## ordinary General Public License).
## 
##   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
## safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
## convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
## &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
## 
##     &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
##     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
## 
##     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
##     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
##     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
##     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
## 
##     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
##     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
##     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
##     Lesser General Public License for more details.
## 
##     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
##     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
##     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
## 
## Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
## 
## You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
## school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if
## necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
## 
##   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.9</span> The “GNU Lesser General Public License” version 3</h2>
<pre><code>##                    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
##                        Version 3, 29 June 2007
## 
##  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;
##  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
##  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
## 
## 
##   This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
## the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
## License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
## 
##   0. Additional Definitions.
## 
##   As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
## General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU
## General Public License.
## 
##   &quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,
## other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
## 
##   An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided
## by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
## Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
## of using an interface provided by the Library.
## 
##   A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an
## Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
## with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked
## Version&quot;.
## 
##   The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the
## Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
## for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
## based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
## 
##   The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the
## object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
## and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
## Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
## 
##   1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
## 
##   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
## without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
## 
##   2. Conveying Modified Versions.
## 
##   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
## facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
## that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
## facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
## version:
## 
##    a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
##    ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
##    function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
##    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
## 
##    b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
##    this License applicable to that copy.
## 
##   3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
## 
##   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
## a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
## code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
## material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
## layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
## (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
## 
##    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
##    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
##    covered by this License.
## 
##    b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
##    document.
## 
##   4. Combined Works.
## 
##   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
## taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
## portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
## engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
## the following:
## 
##    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
##    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
##    covered by this License.
## 
##    b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
##    document.
## 
##    c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
##    execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
##    these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
##    copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
## 
##    d) Do one of the following:
## 
##        0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
##        License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
##        suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
##        recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
##        the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
##        manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
##        Corresponding Source.
## 
##        1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
##        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
##        a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer
##        system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
##        of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
##        Version.
## 
##    e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
##    be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
##    GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
##    necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
##    Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
##    Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
##    you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
##    the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
##    Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
##    Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
##    for conveying Corresponding Source.)
## 
##   5. Combined Libraries.
## 
##   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
## Library side by side in a single library together with other library
## facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
## License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
## choice, if you do both of the following:
## 
##    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
##    on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
##    conveyed under the terms of this License.
## 
##    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
##    is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
##    accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
## 
##   6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
## 
##   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
## of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
## versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
## differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
## 
##   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
## Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
## of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot;
## applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
## conditions either of that published version or of any later version
## published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
## received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
## General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
## General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
## 
##   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
## whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
## apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is
## permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
## Library.</code></pre>

## Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
## 
## Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
## conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
## original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
## and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
## following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
## exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
## 
##      Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
##      intended for use by those authorized to give the public
##      permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
##      copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
##      irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
##      and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
##      Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
##      applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
##      material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
##      material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
##      licensed material, or material used under an exception or
##      limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
##  wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
## 
##      Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
##      licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
##      licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
##      the licensor&#39;s permission is not necessary for any reason--for
##      example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
##      copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
##      licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
##      other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
##      the licensed material may still be restricted for other
##      reasons, including because others have copyright or other
##      rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
##      such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
##      Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
##      respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

## 
##   a. License grant.
## 
##        1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
##           the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
##           non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
##           exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
## 
##             a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
##                in part; and
## 
##             b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
## 
##        2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
##           Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
##           License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
##           its terms and conditions.
## 
##        3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
##           6(a).
## 
##        4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
##           Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
##           all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
##           and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
##           Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
##           authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
##           necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
##           technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
##           Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
##           simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
##           (4) never produces Adapted Material.
## 
##        5. Downstream recipients.
## 
##             a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
##                recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
##                receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
##                Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
##                Public License.
## 
##             b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
##                Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
##                automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
##                exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
##                under the conditions of the Adapter&#39;s License You apply.
## 
##             c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
##                any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
##                apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
##                Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
##                Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
##                Material.
## 
##        6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
##           may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
##           are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
##           with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
##           the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
##           provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
## 
##   b. Other rights.
## 
##        1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
##           licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
##           privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
##           the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
##           assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
##           extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
##           Rights, but not otherwise.
## 
##        2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
##           Public License.
## 
##        3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
##           collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
##           Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
##           under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
##           licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
##           reserves any right to collect such royalties.
## 
## 
## Section 3 -- License Conditions.
## 
## Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
## following conditions.
## 
##   a. Attribution.
## 
##        1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
##           form), You must:
## 
##             a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
##                with the Licensed Material:
## 
##                  i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
##                     Material and any others designated to receive

##        2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
##           reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in

## 
##   b. ShareAlike.
## 
##      In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
##      Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
## 
##        1. The Adapter&#39;s License You apply must be a Creative Commons
##           license with the same License Elements, this version or
##           later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.
## 
##        2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
##           Adapter&#39;s License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
##           in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
##           context in which You Share Adapted Material.
## 
##        3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
##           or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
##           Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
##           rights granted under the Adapter&#39;s License You apply.
## 
## 
## Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
## 
## Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
## apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
## 
##   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
##      to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
##      portion of the contents of the database;
## 
##   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
##      contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
##      Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
##      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
## 
##      including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
##   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
##      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
## 
## For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
## replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
## Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
## 
## 
## Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
## 
##   a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
##      EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
##      AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
##      ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
##      IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
##      WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
##      PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
##      ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
##      KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
##      ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
## 
##   b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
##      TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
##      NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
##      INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
##      COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
##      USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
##      ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
##      DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
##      IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
## 
##   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
##      above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
##      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
##      waiver of all liability.
## 
## 
## Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
## 
##   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
##      Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
##      this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
##      terminate automatically.
## 
##   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
##      Section 6(a), it reinstates:
## 
##        1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
##           it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
##           violation; or
## 
##        2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
## 
##      For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
##      right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
##      of this Public License.
## 
##   c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
##      Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
##      distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
##      will not terminate this Public License.
## 
##   d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
##      License.
## 
## 
## Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
## 
##   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
##      terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
## 
##   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
##      Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
##      independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
## 
## 
## Section 8 -- Interpretation.
## 
##   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
##      shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
##      conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
##      be made without permission under this Public License.
## 
##   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
##      deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
##      minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
##      cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
##      without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
##      conditions.
## 
##   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
##      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
##      Licensor.
## 
##   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
##      as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
##      that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
##      processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
