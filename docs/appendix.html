<pre><code>##                     GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
##                        Version 3, 19 November 2007
## 
##  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;
##  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
##  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
## 
##                             Preamble
## 
##   The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
## software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
## cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
## 
##   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
## to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
## our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
## share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
## software for all its users.
## 
##   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
## price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
## have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
## them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
## want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
## free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
## 
##   Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
## with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
## you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
## and/or modify the software.
## 
##   A secondary benefit of defending all users&#39; freedom is that
## improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
## receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
## incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
## encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
## software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
## The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
## letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
## source code to the public.
## 
##   The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
## ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
## to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
## provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
## users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
## a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
## code of the modified version.
## 
##   An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
## published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
## a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
## released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
## this license.
## 
##   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
## modification follow.
## 
##                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
## 
##   0. Definitions.
## 
##   &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
## 
##   &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
## works, such as semiconductor masks.
## 
##   &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
## License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and
## &quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.
## 
##   To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
## in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
## exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the
## earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.
## 
##   A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
## on the Program.
## 
##   To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
## permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
## infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
## computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
## distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
## public, and in some countries other activities as well.
## 
##   To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
## parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
## a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
## 
##   An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;
## to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
## feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
## tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
## extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
## work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
## the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
## menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
## 
##   1. Source Code.
## 
##   The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work
## for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source
## form of a work.
## 
##   A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official
## standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
## interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
## is widely used among developers working in that language.
## 
##   The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other
## than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
## packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
## Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
## Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
## implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
## &quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component
## (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
## (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
## produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
## 
##   The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all
## the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
## work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
## control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&#39;s
## System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
## programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
## which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
## includes interface definition files associated with source files for
## the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
## linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
## such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
## subprograms and other parts of the work.
## 
##   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
## can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
## Source.
## 
##   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
## same work.
## 
##   2. Basic Permissions.
## 
##   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
## copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
## conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
## permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
## covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
## content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
## rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
## 
##   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
## convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
## in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
## of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
## with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
## the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
## not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
## for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
## and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
## your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
## 
##   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
## the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
## makes it unnecessary.
## 
##   3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
## 
##   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
## measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
## 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
## similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
## measures.
## 
##   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
## circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
## is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
## the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
## modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s
## users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of
## technological measures.
## 
##   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
## 
##   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you
## receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
## appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
## keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
## non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
## keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
## recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
## 
##   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
## and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
## 
##   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
## 
##   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
## produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
## terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
## 
##     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
##     it, and giving a relevant date.
## 
##     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
##     released under this License and any conditions added under section
##     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
##     &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.
## 
##     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
##     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
##     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
##     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
##     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
##     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
##     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
## 
##     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
##     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
##     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
##     work need not make them do so.
## 
##   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
## works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
## and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
## in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
## &quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
## used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users
## beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
## in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
## parts of the aggregate.
## 
##   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
## 
##   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
## of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
## machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
## in one of these ways:
## 
##     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
##     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
##     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
##     customarily used for software interchange.
## 
##     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
##     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
##     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
##     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
##     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
##     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
##     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
##     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
##     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
##     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
##     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
## 
##     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
##     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
##     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
##     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
##     with subsection 6b.
## 
##     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
##     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
##     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
##     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
##     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
##     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
##     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
##     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
##     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
##     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
##     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
##     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
## 
##     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
##     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
##     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
##     charge under subsection 6d.
## 
##   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
## from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
## included in conveying the object code work.
## 
##   A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any
## tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
## or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
## into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
## doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
## product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a
## typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
## of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
## actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
## is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
## commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
## the only significant mode of use of the product.
## 
##   &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,
## procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
## and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
## a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
## suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
## code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
## modification has been made.
## 
##   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
## specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
## part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
## User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
## fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
## Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
## by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
## if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
## modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
## been installed in ROM).
## 
##   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
## requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
## for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
## the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
## network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
## adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
## protocols for communication across the network.
## 
##   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
## in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
## documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
## source code form), and must require no special password or key for
## unpacking, reading or copying.
## 
##   7. Additional Terms.
## 
##   &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this
## License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
## Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
## be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
## that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
## apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
## under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
## this License without regard to the additional permissions.
## 
##   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
## remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
## it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
## removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
## additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
## for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
## add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
## that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
## 
##     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
##     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
## 
##     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
##     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
##     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
## 
##     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
##     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
##     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
## 
##     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
##     authors of the material; or
## 
##     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
##     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
## 
##     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
##     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
##     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
##     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
##     those licensors and authors.
## 
##   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further
## restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
## received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
## governed by this License along with a term that is a further
## restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
## a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
## License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
## of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
## not survive such relicensing or conveying.
## 
##   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
## must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
## additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
## where to find the applicable terms.
## 
##   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
## form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
## the above requirements apply either way.
## 
##   8. Termination.
## 
##   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
## provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
## modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
## this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
## paragraph of section 11).
## 
##   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
## license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
## provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
## finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
## holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
## prior to 60 days after the cessation.
## 
##   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
## reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
## violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
## received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
## copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
## your receipt of the notice.
## 
##   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
## licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
## this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
## reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
## material under section 10.
## 
##   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
## 
##   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
## run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
## occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
## to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
## nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
## modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
## not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
## covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
## 
##   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
## 
##   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
## receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
## propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
## for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
## 
##   An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an
## organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
## organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
## work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
## transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
## licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could
## give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
## Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
## the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
## 
##   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
## rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
## not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
## rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
## (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
## any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
## sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
## 
##   11. Patents.
## 
##   A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
## License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
## work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.
## 
##   A contributor&#39;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims
## owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
## hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
## by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
## but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
## consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
## purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant
## patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
## this License.
## 
##   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
## patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to
## make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
## propagate the contents of its contributor version.
## 
##   In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express
## agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
## (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
## sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a
## party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
## patent against the party.
## 
##   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
## and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
## to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
## publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
## then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
## available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
## patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
## consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
## license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have
## actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
## covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work
## in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
## country that you have reason to believe are valid.
## 
##   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
## arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
## covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
## receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
## or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
## you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
## work and works based on it.
## 
##   A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within
## the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
## conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
## specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
## work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
## in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
## to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
## the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
## parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
## patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
## conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
## for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
## contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
## or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
## 
##   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
## any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
## otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
## 
##   12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.
## 
##   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
## otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
## excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
## covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
## License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
## not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
## to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
## the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
## License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
## 
##   13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
## Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
## interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
## supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
## Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
## from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
## means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
## shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
## of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
## following paragraph.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
## permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
## under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
## combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
## License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
## but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
## 3 of the GNU General Public License.
## 
##   14. Revised Versions of this License.
## 
##   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
## the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
## will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
## address new problems or concerns.
## 
##   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
## Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
## Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the
## option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
## version or of any later version published by the Free Software
## Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
## GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
## by the Free Software Foundation.
## 
##   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
## versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s
## public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
## to choose that version for the Program.
## 
##   Later license versions may give you additional or different
## permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
## author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
## later version.
## 
##   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
## 
##   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
## APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
## HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY
## OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
## THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
## PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
## IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
## ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
## 
##   16. Limitation of Liability.
## 
##   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
## WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
## THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
## GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
## USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
## DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
## PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
## EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
## SUCH DAMAGES.
## 
##   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
## 
##   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
## above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
## reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
## an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
## Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
## copy of the Program in return for a fee.
## 
##                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
## 
##             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
## 
##   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
## possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
## free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
## 
##   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
## to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
## state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
## the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
## 
##     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
##     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
## 
##     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
##     it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
##     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
##     (at your option) any later version.
## 
##     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
##     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
##     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
##     GNU Affero General Public License for more details.
## 
##     You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
##     along with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
## 
## Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
## 
##   If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
## network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
## get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
## interface could display a &quot;Source&quot; link that leads users to an archive
## of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
## solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
## specific requirements.
## 
##   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
## if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary.
## For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see

## Preamble
## ********
## 
## This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
## Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.  The
## intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over
## the development of that Package while still keeping the Package
## available as open source and free software.
## 
## You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
## license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
## terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
## make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a
## different licensing arrangement.
## 
## Definitions
## ***********

## accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization,
## to others outside of your company or organization.
## 
## &quot;Distributor Fee&quot; means any fee that you charge for Distributing this
## Package or providing support for this Package to another party.  It does
## not mean licensing fees.
## 
## &quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or
## has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright
## Holder.
## 
## &quot;Modified Version&quot; means the Package, if it has been changed, and such
## changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.
## 
## &quot;Original License&quot; means this Artistic License as Distributed with the
## Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be
## modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
## 
## &quot;Source&quot; form means the source code, documentation source, and
## configuration files for the Package.
## 
## &quot;Compiled&quot; form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any
## other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of
## the Source form.
## 
## Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
## ********************************************************
## 
## (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
## Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you
## do not Distribute the Modified Version.
## 
## Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
## ******************************************************
## 
## (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
## Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
## either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all
## of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At your
## discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form
## of the Package.
## 
## (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
## modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
## Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will
## be subject to the Original License.
## 
## Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
## **********************************************************
## 
## (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or
## for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
## Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from
## the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any
## non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do
## at least ONE of the following:
## 
## (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the
## Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright
## Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.
## 
## (b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent
## the user installing or running the Standard Version.  In addition, the
## Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the
## Standard Version.
## 
## (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the
## Source form of the Modified Version available to others under
## 
## (i) the Original License or
## 
## (ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and
## redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that
## apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the
## Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it,
## be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but
## Distributor Fees are allowed.
## 
## Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified
## ******************************************************************
## Versions without the Source
## ***************************
## 
## (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
## the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
## get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be valid
## at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any time
## while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must
## provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.  If
## you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days
## after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do
## not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
## 
## (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the
## Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the
## Source of the Modified Version.
## 
## Aggregating or Linking the Package
## **********************************
## 
## (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
## Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
## aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
## Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
## components in the aggregation are permitted.  The terms of this license
## apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
## as included in the aggregation.
## 
## (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other
## works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build
## stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the
## Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the
## result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
## 
## Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
## ********************************************************
## 
## (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
## merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
## the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
## considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms
## of this license.
## 
## General Provisions
## ******************
## 
## (10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified
## Versions is governed by this Artistic License.  By using, modifying or
## distributing the Package, you accept this license.  Do not use, modify,
## or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.
## 
## (11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version
## made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure
## that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this
## license.
## 
## (12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
## service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
## 
## (13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge
## patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and
## otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims
## licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the
## Package.  If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or
## counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes
## direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License
## to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.
## 
## (14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT

<pre><code>##                     GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
##                        Version 3, 19 November 2007
## 
##  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;
##  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
##  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
## 
##                             Preamble
## 
##   The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
## software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
## cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
## 
##   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
## to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
## our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
## share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
## software for all its users.
## 
##   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
## price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
## have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
## them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
## want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
## free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
## 
##   Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
## with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
## you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
## and/or modify the software.
## 
##   A secondary benefit of defending all users&#39; freedom is that
## improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
## receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
## incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
## encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
## software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
## The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
## letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
## source code to the public.
## 
##   The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
## ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
## to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
## provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
## users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
## a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
## code of the modified version.
## 
##   An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
## published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
## a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
## released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
## this license.
## 
##   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
## modification follow.
## 
##                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
## 
##   0. Definitions.
## 
##   &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
## 
##   &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
## works, such as semiconductor masks.
## 
##   &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
## License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and
## &quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.
## 
##   To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
## in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
## exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the
## earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.
## 
##   A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
## on the Program.
## 
##   To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
## permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
## infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
## computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
## distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
## public, and in some countries other activities as well.
## 
##   To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
## parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
## a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
## 
##   An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;
## to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
## feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
## tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
## extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
## work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
## the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
## menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
## 
##   1. Source Code.
## 
##   The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work
## for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source
## form of a work.
## 
##   A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official
## standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
## interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
## is widely used among developers working in that language.
## 
##   The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other
## than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
## packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
## Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
## Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
## implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
## &quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component
## (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
## (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
## produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
## 
##   The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all
## the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
## work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
## control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&#39;s
## System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
## programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
## which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
## includes interface definition files associated with source files for
## the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
## linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
## such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
## subprograms and other parts of the work.
## 
##   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
## can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
## Source.
## 
##   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
## same work.
## 
##   2. Basic Permissions.
## 
##   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
## copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
## conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
## permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
## covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
## content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
## rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
## 
##   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
## convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
## in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
## of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
## with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
## the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
## not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
## for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
## and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
## your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
## 
##   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
## the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
## makes it unnecessary.
## 
##   3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
## 
##   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
## measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
## 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
## similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
## measures.
## 
##   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
## circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
## is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
## the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
## modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s
## users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of
## technological measures.
## 
##   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
## 
##   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you
## receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
## appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
## keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
## non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
## keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
## recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
## 
##   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
## and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
## 
##   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
## 
##   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
## produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
## terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
## 
##     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
##     it, and giving a relevant date.
## 
##     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
##     released under this License and any conditions added under section
##     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
##     &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.
## 
##     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
##     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
##     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
##     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
##     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
##     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
##     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
## 
##     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
##     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
##     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
##     work need not make them do so.
## 
##   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
## works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
## and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
## in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
## &quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
## used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users
## beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
## in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
## parts of the aggregate.
## 
##   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
## 
##   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
## of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
## machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
## in one of these ways:
## 
##     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
##     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
##     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
##     customarily used for software interchange.
## 
##     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
##     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
##     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
##     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
##     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
##     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
##     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
##     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
##     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
##     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
##     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
## 
##     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
##     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
##     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
##     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
##     with subsection 6b.
## 
##     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
##     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
##     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
##     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
##     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
##     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
##     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
##     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
##     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
##     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
##     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
##     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
## 
##     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
##     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
##     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
##     charge under subsection 6d.
## 
##   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
## from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
## included in conveying the object code work.
## 
##   A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any
## tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
## or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
## into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
## doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
## product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a
## typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
## of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
## actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
## is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
## commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
## the only significant mode of use of the product.
## 
##   &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,
## procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
## and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
## a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
## suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
## code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
## modification has been made.
## 
##   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
## specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
## part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
## User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
## fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
## Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
## by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
## if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
## modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
## been installed in ROM).
## 
##   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
## requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
## for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
## the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
## network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
## adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
## protocols for communication across the network.
## 
##   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
## in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
## documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
## source code form), and must require no special password or key for
## unpacking, reading or copying.
## 
##   7. Additional Terms.
## 
##   &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this
## License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
## Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
## be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
## that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
## apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
## under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
## this License without regard to the additional permissions.
## 
##   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
## remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
## it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
## removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
## additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
## for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
## add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
## that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
## 
##     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
##     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
## 
##     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
##     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
##     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
## 
##     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
##     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
##     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
## 
##     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
##     authors of the material; or
## 
##     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
##     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
## 
##     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
##     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
##     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
##     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
##     those licensors and authors.
## 
##   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further
## restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
## received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
## governed by this License along with a term that is a further
## restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
## a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
## License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
## of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
## not survive such relicensing or conveying.
## 
##   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
## must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
## additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
## where to find the applicable terms.
## 
##   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
## form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
## the above requirements apply either way.
## 
##   8. Termination.
## 
##   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
## provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
## modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
## this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
## paragraph of section 11).
## 
##   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
## license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
## provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
## finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
## holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
## prior to 60 days after the cessation.
## 
##   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
## reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
## violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
## received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
## copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
## your receipt of the notice.
## 
##   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
## licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
## this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
## reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
## material under section 10.
## 
##   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
## 
##   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
## run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
## occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
## to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
## nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
## modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
## not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
## covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
## 
##   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
## 
##   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
## receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
## propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
## for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
## 
##   An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an
## organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
## organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
## work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
## transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
## licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could
## give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
## Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
## the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
## 
##   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
## rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
## not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
## rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
## (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
## any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
## sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
## 
##   11. Patents.
## 
##   A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
## License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
## work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.
## 
##   A contributor&#39;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims
## owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
## hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
## by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
## but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
## consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
## purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant
## patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
## this License.
## 
##   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
## patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to
## make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
## propagate the contents of its contributor version.
## 
##   In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express
## agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
## (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
## sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a
## party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
## patent against the party.
## 
##   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
## and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
## to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
## publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
## then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
## available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
## patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
## consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
## license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have
## actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
## covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work
## in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
## country that you have reason to believe are valid.
## 
##   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
## arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
## covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
## receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
## or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
## you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
## work and works based on it.
## 
##   A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within
## the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
## conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
## specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
## work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
## in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
## to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
## the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
## parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
## patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
## conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
## for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
## contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
## or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
## 
##   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
## any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
## otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
## 
##   12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.
## 
##   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
## otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
## excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
## covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
## License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
## not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
## to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
## the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
## License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
## 
##   13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
## Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
## interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
## supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
## Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
## from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
## means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
## shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
## of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
## following paragraph.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
## permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
## under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
## combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
## License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
## but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
## 3 of the GNU General Public License.
## 
##   14. Revised Versions of this License.
## 
##   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
## the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
## will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
## address new problems or concerns.
## 
##   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
## Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
## Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the
## option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
## version or of any later version published by the Free Software
## Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
## GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
## by the Free Software Foundation.
## 
##   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
## versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s
## public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
## to choose that version for the Program.
## 
##   Later license versions may give you additional or different
## permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
## author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
## later version.
## 
##   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
## 
##   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
## APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
## HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY
## OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
## THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
## PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
## IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
## ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
## 
##   16. Limitation of Liability.
## 
##   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
## WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
## THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
## GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
## USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
## DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
## PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
## EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
## SUCH DAMAGES.
## 
##   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
## 
##   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
## above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
## reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
## an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
## Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
## copy of the Program in return for a fee.
## 
##                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
## 
##             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
## 
##   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
## possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
## free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
## 
##   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
## to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
## state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
## the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
## 
##     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
##     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
## 
##     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
##     it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
##     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
##     (at your option) any later version.
## 
##     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
##     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
##     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
##     GNU Affero General Public License for more details.
## 
##     You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
##     along with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
## 
## Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
## 
##   If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
## network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
## get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
## interface could display a &quot;Source&quot; link that leads users to an archive
## of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
## solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
## specific requirements.
## 
##   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
## if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.8</span> The The “GNU Affero General Public License” version 3</h2>
<pre><code>##                     GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
##                        Version 3, 19 November 2007
## 
##  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;
##  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
##  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
## 
##                             Preamble
## 
##   The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
## software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
## cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
## 
##   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
## to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
## our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
## share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
## software for all its users.
## 
##   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
## price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
## have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
## them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
## want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
## free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
## 
##   Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
## with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
## you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
## and/or modify the software.
## 
##   A secondary benefit of defending all users&#39; freedom is that
## improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
## receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
## incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
## encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
## software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
## The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
## letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
## source code to the public.
## 
##   The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
## ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
## to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
## provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
## users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
## a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
## code of the modified version.
## 
##   An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
## published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
## a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
## released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
## this license.
## 
##   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
## modification follow.
## 
##                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
## 
##   0. Definitions.
## 
##   &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
## 
##   &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
## works, such as semiconductor masks.
## 
##   &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
## License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and
## &quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.
## 
##   To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
## in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
## exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the
## earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.
## 
##   A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
## on the Program.
## 
##   To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
## permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
## infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
## computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
## distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
## public, and in some countries other activities as well.
## 
##   To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
## parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
## a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
## 
##   An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;
## to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
## feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
## tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
## extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
## work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
## the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
## menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
## 
##   1. Source Code.
## 
##   The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work
## for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source
## form of a work.
## 
##   A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official
## standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
## interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
## is widely used among developers working in that language.
## 
##   The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other
## than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
## packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
## Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
## Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
## implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
## &quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component
## (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
## (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
## produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
## 
##   The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all
## the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
## work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
## control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&#39;s
## System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
## programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
## which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
## includes interface definition files associated with source files for
## the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
## linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
## such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
## subprograms and other parts of the work.
## 
##   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
## can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
## Source.
## 
##   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
## same work.
## 
##   2. Basic Permissions.
## 
##   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
## copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
## conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
## permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
## covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
## content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
## rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
## 
##   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
## convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
## in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
## of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
## with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
## the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
## not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
## for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
## and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
## your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
## 
##   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
## the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
## makes it unnecessary.
## 
##   3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
## 
##   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
## measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
## 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
## similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
## measures.
## 
##   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
## circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
## is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
## the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
## modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s
## users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of
## technological measures.
## 
##   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
## 
##   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you
## receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
## appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
## keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
## non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
## keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
## recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
## 
##   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
## and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
## 
##   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
## 
##   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
## produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
## terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
## 
##     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
##     it, and giving a relevant date.
## 
##     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
##     released under this License and any conditions added under section
##     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
##     &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.
## 
##     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
##     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
##     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
##     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
##     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
##     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
##     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
## 
##     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
##     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
##     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
##     work need not make them do so.
## 
##   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
## works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
## and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
## in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
## &quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
## used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users
## beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
## in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
## parts of the aggregate.
## 
##   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
## 
##   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
## of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
## machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
## in one of these ways:
## 
##     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
##     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
##     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
##     customarily used for software interchange.
## 
##     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
##     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
##     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
##     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
##     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
##     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
##     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
##     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
##     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
##     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
##     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
## 
##     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
##     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
##     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
##     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
##     with subsection 6b.
## 
##     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
##     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
##     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
##     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
##     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
##     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
##     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
##     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
##     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
##     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
##     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
##     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
## 
##     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
##     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
##     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
##     charge under subsection 6d.
## 
##   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
## from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
## included in conveying the object code work.
## 
##   A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any
## tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
## or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
## into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
## doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
## product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a
## typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
## of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
## actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
## is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
## commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
## the only significant mode of use of the product.
## 
##   &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,
## procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
## and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
## a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
## suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
## code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
## modification has been made.
## 
##   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
## specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
## part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
## User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
## fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
## Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
## by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
## if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
## modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
## been installed in ROM).
## 
##   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
## requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
## for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
## the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
## network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
## adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
## protocols for communication across the network.
## 
##   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
## in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
## documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
## source code form), and must require no special password or key for
## unpacking, reading or copying.
## 
##   7. Additional Terms.
## 
##   &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this
## License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
## Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
## be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
## that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
## apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
## under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
## this License without regard to the additional permissions.
## 
##   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
## remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
## it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
## removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
## additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
## for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
## add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
## that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
## 
##     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
##     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
## 
##     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
##     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
##     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
## 
##     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
##     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
##     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
## 
##     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
##     authors of the material; or
## 
##     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
##     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
## 
##     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
##     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
##     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
##     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
##     those licensors and authors.
## 
##   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further
## restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
## received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
## governed by this License along with a term that is a further
## restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
## a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
## License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
## of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
## not survive such relicensing or conveying.
## 
##   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
## must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
## additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
## where to find the applicable terms.
## 
##   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
## form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
## the above requirements apply either way.
## 
##   8. Termination.
## 
##   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
## provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
## modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
## this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
## paragraph of section 11).
## 
##   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
## license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
## provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
## finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
## holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
## prior to 60 days after the cessation.
## 
##   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
## reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
## violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
## received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
## copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
## your receipt of the notice.
## 
##   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
## licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
## this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
## reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
## material under section 10.
## 
##   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
## 
##   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
## run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
## occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
## to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
## nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
## modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
## not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
## covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
## 
##   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
## 
##   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
## receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
## propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
## for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
## 
##   An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an
## organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
## organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
## work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
## transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
## licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could
## give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
## Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
## the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
## 
##   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
## rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
## not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
## rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
## (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
## any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
## sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
## 
##   11. Patents.
## 
##   A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
## License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
## work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.
## 
##   A contributor&#39;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims
## owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
## hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
## by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
## but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
## consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
## purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant
## patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
## this License.
## 
##   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
## patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to
## make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
## propagate the contents of its contributor version.
## 
##   In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express
## agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
## (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
## sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a
## party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
## patent against the party.
## 
##   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
## and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
## to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
## publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
## then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
## available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
## patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
## consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
## license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have
## actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
## covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work
## in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
## country that you have reason to believe are valid.
## 
##   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
## arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
## covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
## receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
## or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
## you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
## work and works based on it.
## 
##   A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within
## the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
## conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
## specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
## work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
## in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
## to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
## the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
## parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
## patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
## conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
## for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
## contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
## or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
## 
##   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
## any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
## otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
## 
##   12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.
## 
##   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
## otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
## excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
## covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
## License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
## not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
## to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
## the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
## License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
## 
##   13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
## Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
## interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
## supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
## Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
## from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
## means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
## shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
## of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
## following paragraph.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
## permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
## under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
## combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
## License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
## but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
## 3 of the GNU General Public License.
## 
##   14. Revised Versions of this License.
## 
##   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
## the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
## will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
## address new problems or concerns.
## 
##   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
## Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
## Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the
## option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
## version or of any later version published by the Free Software
## Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
## GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
## by the Free Software Foundation.
## 
##   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
## versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s
## public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
## to choose that version for the Program.
## 
##   Later license versions may give you additional or different
## permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
## author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
## later version.
## 
##   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
## 
##   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
## APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
## HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY
## OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
## THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
## PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
## IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
## ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
## 
##   16. Limitation of Liability.
## 
##   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
## WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
## THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
## GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
## USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
## DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
## PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
## EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
## SUCH DAMAGES.
## 
##   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
## 
##   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
## above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
## reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
## an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
## Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
## copy of the Program in return for a fee.
## 
##                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
## 
##             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
## 
##   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
## possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
## free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
## 
##   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
## to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
## state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
## the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
## 
##     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
##     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
## 
##     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
##     it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
##     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
##     (at your option) any later version.
## 
##     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
##     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
##     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
##     GNU Affero General Public License for more details.
## 
##     You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
##     along with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
## 
## Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
## 
##   If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
## network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
## get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
## interface could display a &quot;Source&quot; link that leads users to an archive
## of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
## solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
## specific requirements.
## 
##   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
## if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.9</span> The The “GNU Affero General Public License” version 3</h2>
<pre><code>##                     GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
##                        Version 3, 19 November 2007
## 
##  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;
##  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
##  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
## 
##                             Preamble
## 
##   The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
## software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
## cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
## 
##   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
## to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
## our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
## share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
## software for all its users.
## 
##   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
## price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
## have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
## them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
## want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
## free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
## 
##   Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
## with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
## you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
## and/or modify the software.
## 
##   A secondary benefit of defending all users&#39; freedom is that
## improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
## receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
## incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
## encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
## software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
## The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
## letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
## source code to the public.
## 
##   The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
## ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
## to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
## provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
## users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
## a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
## code of the modified version.
## 
##   An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
## published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
## a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
## released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
## this license.
## 
##   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
## modification follow.
## 
##                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
## 
##   0. Definitions.
## 
##   &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
## 
##   &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
## works, such as semiconductor masks.
## 
##   &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
## License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and
## &quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.
## 
##   To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
## in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
## exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the
## earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.
## 
##   A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
## on the Program.
## 
##   To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
## permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
## infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
## computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
## distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
## public, and in some countries other activities as well.
## 
##   To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
## parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
## a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
## 
##   An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;
## to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
## feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
## tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
## extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
## work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
## the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
## menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
## 
##   1. Source Code.
## 
##   The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work
## for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source
## form of a work.
## 
##   A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official
## standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
## interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
## is widely used among developers working in that language.
## 
##   The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other
## than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
## packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
## Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
## Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
## implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
## &quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component
## (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
## (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
## produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
## 
##   The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all
## the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
## work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
## control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&#39;s
## System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
## programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
## which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
## includes interface definition files associated with source files for
## the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
## linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
## such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
## subprograms and other parts of the work.
## 
##   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
## can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
## Source.
## 
##   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
## same work.
## 
##   2. Basic Permissions.
## 
##   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
## copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
## conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
## permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
## covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
## content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
## rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
## 
##   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
## convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
## in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
## of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
## with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
## the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
## not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
## for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
## and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
## your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
## 
##   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
## the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
## makes it unnecessary.
## 
##   3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
## 
##   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
## measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
## 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
## similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
## measures.
## 
##   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
## circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
## is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
## the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
## modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s
## users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of
## technological measures.
## 
##   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
## 
##   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you
## receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
## appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
## keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
## non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
## keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
## recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
## 
##   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
## and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
## 
##   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
## 
##   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
## produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
## terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
## 
##     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
##     it, and giving a relevant date.
## 
##     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
##     released under this License and any conditions added under section
##     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
##     &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.
## 
##     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
##     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
##     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
##     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
##     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
##     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
##     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
## 
##     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
##     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
##     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
##     work need not make them do so.
## 
##   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
## works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
## and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
## in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
## &quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
## used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users
## beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
## in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
## parts of the aggregate.
## 
##   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
## 
##   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
## of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
## machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
## in one of these ways:
## 
##     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
##     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
##     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
##     customarily used for software interchange.
## 
##     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
##     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
##     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
##     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
##     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
##     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
##     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
##     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
##     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
##     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
##     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
## 
##     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
##     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
##     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
##     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
##     with subsection 6b.
## 
##     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
##     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
##     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
##     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
##     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
##     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
##     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
##     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
##     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
##     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
##     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
##     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
## 
##     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
##     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
##     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
##     charge under subsection 6d.
## 
##   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
## from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
## included in conveying the object code work.
## 
##   A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any
## tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
## or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
## into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
## doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
## product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a
## typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
## of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
## actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
## is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
## commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
## the only significant mode of use of the product.
## 
##   &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,
## procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
## and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
## a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
## suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
## code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
## modification has been made.
## 
##   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
## specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
## part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
## User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
## fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
## Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
## by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
## if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
## modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
## been installed in ROM).
## 
##   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
## requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
## for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
## the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
## network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
## adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
## protocols for communication across the network.
## 
##   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
## in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
## documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
## source code form), and must require no special password or key for
## unpacking, reading or copying.
## 
##   7. Additional Terms.
## 
##   &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this
## License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
## Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
## be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
## that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
## apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
## under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
## this License without regard to the additional permissions.
## 
##   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
## remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
## it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
## removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
## additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
## for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
## add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
## that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
## 
##     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
##     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
## 
##     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
##     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
##     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
## 
##     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
##     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
##     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
## 
##     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
##     authors of the material; or
## 
##     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
##     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
## 
##     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
##     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
##     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
##     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
##     those licensors and authors.
## 
##   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further
## restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
## received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
## governed by this License along with a term that is a further
## restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
## a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
## License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
## of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
## not survive such relicensing or conveying.
## 
##   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
## must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
## additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
## where to find the applicable terms.
## 
##   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
## form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
## the above requirements apply either way.
## 
##   8. Termination.
## 
##   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
## provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
## modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
## this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
## paragraph of section 11).
## 
##   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
## license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
## provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
## finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
## holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
## prior to 60 days after the cessation.
## 
##   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
## reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
## violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
## received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
## copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
## your receipt of the notice.
## 
##   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
## licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
## this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
## reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
## material under section 10.
## 
##   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
## 
##   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
## run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
## occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
## to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
## nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
## modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
## not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
## covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
## 
##   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
## 
##   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
## receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
## propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
## for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
## 
##   An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an
## organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
## organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
## work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
## transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
## licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could
## give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
## Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
## the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
## 
##   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
## rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
## not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
## rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
## (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
## any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
## sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
## 
##   11. Patents.
## 
##   A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
## License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
## work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.
## 
##   A contributor&#39;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims
## owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
## hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
## by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
## but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
## consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
## purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant
## patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
## this License.
## 
##   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
## patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to
## make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
## propagate the contents of its contributor version.
## 
##   In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express
## agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
## (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
## sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a
## party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
## patent against the party.
## 
##   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
## and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
## to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
## publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
## then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
## available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
## patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
## consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
## license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have
## actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
## covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work
## in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
## country that you have reason to believe are valid.
## 
##   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
## arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
## covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
## receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
## or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
## you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
## work and works based on it.
## 
##   A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within
## the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
## conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
## specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
## work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
## in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
## to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
## the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
## parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
## patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
## conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
## for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
## contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
## or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
## 
##   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
## any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
## otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
## 
##   12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.
## 
##   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
## otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
## excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
## covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
## License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
## not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
## to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
## the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
## License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
## 
##   13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
## Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
## interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
## supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
## Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
## from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
## means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
## shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
## of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
## following paragraph.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
## permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
## under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
## combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
## License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
## but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
## 3 of the GNU General Public License.
## 
##   14. Revised Versions of this License.
## 
##   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
## the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
## will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
## address new problems or concerns.
## 
##   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
## Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
## Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the
## option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
## version or of any later version published by the Free Software
## Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
## GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
## by the Free Software Foundation.
## 
##   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
## versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s
## public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
## to choose that version for the Program.
## 
##   Later license versions may give you additional or different
## permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
## author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
## later version.
## 
##   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
## 
##   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
## APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
## HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY
## OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
## THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
## PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
## IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
## ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
## 
##   16. Limitation of Liability.
## 
##   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
## WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
## THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
## GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
## USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
## DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
## PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
## EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
## SUCH DAMAGES.
## 
##   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
## 
##   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
## above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
## reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
## an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
## Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
## copy of the Program in return for a fee.
## 
##                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
## 
##             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
## 
##   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
## possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
## free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
## 
##   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
## to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
## state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
## the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
## 
##     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
##     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
## 
##     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
##     it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
##     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
##     (at your option) any later version.
## 
##     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
##     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
##     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
##     GNU Affero General Public License for more details.
## 
##     You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
##     along with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
## 
## Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
## 
##   If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
## network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
## get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
## interface could display a &quot;Source&quot; link that leads users to an archive
## of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
## solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
## specific requirements.
## 
##   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
## if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary.
## For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.10</span> The The “GNU Affero General Public License” version 3</h2>
<pre><code>##                     GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
##                        Version 3, 19 November 2007
## 
##  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;
##  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
##  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
## 
##                             Preamble
## 
##   The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
## software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
## cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
## 
##   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
## to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
## our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
## share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
## software for all its users.
## 
##   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
## price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
## have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
## them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
## want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
## free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
## 
##   Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
## with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
## you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
## and/or modify the software.
## 
##   A secondary benefit of defending all users&#39; freedom is that
## improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
## receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
## incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
## encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
## software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
## The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
## letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
## source code to the public.
## 
##   The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
## ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
## to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
## provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
## users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
## a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
## code of the modified version.
## 
##   An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
## published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
## a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
## released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
## this license.
## 
##   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
## modification follow.
## 
##                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
## 
##   0. Definitions.
## 
##   &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
## 
##   &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
## works, such as semiconductor masks.
## 
##   &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
## License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and
## &quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.
## 
##   To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
## in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
## exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the
## earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.
## 
##   A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
## on the Program.
## 
##   To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
## permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
## infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
## computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
## distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
## public, and in some countries other activities as well.
## 
##   To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
## parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
## a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
## 
##   An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;
## to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
## feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
## tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
## extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
## work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
## the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
## menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
## 
##   1. Source Code.
## 
##   The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work
## for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source
## form of a work.
## 
##   A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official
## standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
## interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
## is widely used among developers working in that language.
## 
##   The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other
## than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
## packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
## Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
## Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
## implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
## &quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component
## (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
## (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
## produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
## 
##   The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all
## the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
## work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
## control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&#39;s
## System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
## programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
## which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
## includes interface definition files associated with source files for
## the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
## linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
## such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
## subprograms and other parts of the work.
## 
##   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
## can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
## Source.
## 
##   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
## same work.
## 
##   2. Basic Permissions.
## 
##   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
## copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
## conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
## permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
## covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
## content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
## rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
## 
##   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
## convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
## in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
## of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
## with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
## the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
## not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
## for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
## and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
## your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
## 
##   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
## the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
## makes it unnecessary.
## 
##   3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
## 
##   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
## measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
## 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
## similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
## measures.
## 
##   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
## circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
## is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
## the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
## modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s
## users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of
## technological measures.
## 
##   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
## 
##   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you
## receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
## appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
## keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
## non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
## keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
## recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
## 
##   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
## and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
## 
##   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
## 
##   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
## produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
## terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
## 
##     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
##     it, and giving a relevant date.
## 
##     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
##     released under this License and any conditions added under section
##     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
##     &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.
## 
##     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
##     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
##     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
##     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
##     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
##     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
##     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
## 
##     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
##     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
##     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
##     work need not make them do so.
## 
##   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
## works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
## and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
## in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
## &quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
## used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users
## beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
## in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
## parts of the aggregate.
## 
##   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
## 
##   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
## of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
## machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
## in one of these ways:
## 
##     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
##     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
##     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
##     customarily used for software interchange.
## 
##     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
##     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
##     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
##     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
##     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
##     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
##     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
##     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
##     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
##     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
##     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
## 
##     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
##     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
##     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
##     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
##     with subsection 6b.
## 
##     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
##     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
##     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
##     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
##     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
##     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
##     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
##     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
##     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
##     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
##     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
##     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
## 
##     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
##     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
##     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
##     charge under subsection 6d.
## 
##   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
## from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
## included in conveying the object code work.
## 
##   A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any
## tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
## or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
## into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
## doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
## product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a
## typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
## of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
## actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
## is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
## commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
## the only significant mode of use of the product.
## 
##   &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,
## procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
## and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
## a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
## suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
## code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
## modification has been made.
## 
##   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
## specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
## part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
## User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
## fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
## Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
## by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
## if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
## modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
## been installed in ROM).
## 
##   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
## requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
## for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
## the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
## network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
## adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
## protocols for communication across the network.
## 
##   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
## in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
## documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
## source code form), and must require no special password or key for
## unpacking, reading or copying.
## 
##   7. Additional Terms.
## 
##   &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this
## License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
## Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
## be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
## that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
## apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
## under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
## this License without regard to the additional permissions.
## 
##   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
## remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
## it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
## removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
## additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
## for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
## add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
## that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
## 
##     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
##     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
## 
##     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
##     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
##     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
## 
##     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
##     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
##     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
## 
##     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
##     authors of the material; or
## 
##     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
##     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
## 
##     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
##     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
##     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
##     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
##     those licensors and authors.
## 
##   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further
## restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
## received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
## governed by this License along with a term that is a further
## restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
## a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
## License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
## of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
## not survive such relicensing or conveying.
## 
##   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
## must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
## additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
## where to find the applicable terms.
## 
##   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
## form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
## the above requirements apply either way.
## 
##   8. Termination.
## 
##   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
## provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
## modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
## this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
## paragraph of section 11).
## 
##   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
## license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
## provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
## finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
## holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
## prior to 60 days after the cessation.
## 
##   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
## reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
## violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
## received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
## copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
## your receipt of the notice.
## 
##   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
## licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
## this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
## reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
## material under section 10.
## 
##   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
## 
##   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
## run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
## occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
## to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
## nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
## modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
## not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
## covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
## 
##   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
## 
##   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
## receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
## propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
## for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
## 
##   An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an
## organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
## organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
## work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
## transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
## licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could
## give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
## Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
## the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
## 
##   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
## rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
## not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
## rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
## (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
## any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
## sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
## 
##   11. Patents.
## 
##   A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
## License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
## work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.
## 
##   A contributor&#39;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims
## owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
## hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
## by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
## but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
## consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
## purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant
## patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
## this License.
## 
##   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
## patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to
## make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
## propagate the contents of its contributor version.
## 
##   In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express
## agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
## (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
## sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a
## party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
## patent against the party.
## 
##   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
## and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
## to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
## publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
## then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
## available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
## patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
## consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
## license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have
## actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
## covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work
## in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
## country that you have reason to believe are valid.
## 
##   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
## arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
## covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
## receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
## or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
## you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
## work and works based on it.
## 
##   A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within
## the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
## conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
## specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
## work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
## in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
## to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
## the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
## parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
## patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
## conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
## for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
## contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
## or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
## 
##   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
## any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
## otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
## 
##   12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.
## 
##   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
## otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
## excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
## covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
## License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
## not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
## to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
## the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
## License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
## 
##   13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
## Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
## interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
## supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
## Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
## from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
## means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
## shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
## of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
## following paragraph.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
## permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
## under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
## combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
## License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
## but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
## 3 of the GNU General Public License.
## 
##   14. Revised Versions of this License.
## 
##   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
## the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
## will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
## address new problems or concerns.
## 
##   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
## Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
## Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the
## option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
## version or of any later version published by the Free Software
## Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
## GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
## by the Free Software Foundation.
## 
##   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
## versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s
## public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
## to choose that version for the Program.
## 
##   Later license versions may give you additional or different
## permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
## author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
## later version.
## 
##   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
## 
##   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
## APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
## HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY
## OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
## THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
## PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
## IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
## ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
## 
##   16. Limitation of Liability.
## 
##   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
## WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
## THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
## GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
## USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
## DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
## PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
## EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
## SUCH DAMAGES.
## 
##   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
## 
##   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
## above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
## reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
## an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
## Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
## copy of the Program in return for a fee.
## 
##                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
## 
##             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
## 
##   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
## possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
## free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
## 
##   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
## to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
## state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
## the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
## 
##     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
##     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
## 
##     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
##     it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
##     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
##     (at your option) any later version.
## 
##     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
##     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
##     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
##     GNU Affero General Public License for more details.
## 
##     You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
##     along with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
## 
## Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
## 
##   If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
## network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
## get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
## interface could display a &quot;Source&quot; link that leads users to an archive
## of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
## solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
## specific requirements.
## 
##   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
## if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary.
## For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see

<pre><code>##                     GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
##                        Version 3, 19 November 2007
## 
##  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;
##  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
##  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
## 
##                             Preamble
## 
##   The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
## software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
## cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
## 
##   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
## to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
## our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
## share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
## software for all its users.
## 
##   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
## price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
## have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
## them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
## want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
## free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
## 
##   Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
## with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
## you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
## and/or modify the software.
## 
##   A secondary benefit of defending all users&#39; freedom is that
## improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
## receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
## incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
## encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
## software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
## The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
## letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
## source code to the public.
## 
##   The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
## ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
## to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
## provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
## users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
## a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
## code of the modified version.
## 
##   An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
## published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
## a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
## released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
## this license.
## 
##   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
## modification follow.
## 
##                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
## 
##   0. Definitions.
## 
##   &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
## 
##   &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
## works, such as semiconductor masks.
## 
##   &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
## License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and
## &quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.
## 
##   To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
## in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
## exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the
## earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.
## 
##   A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
## on the Program.
## 
##   To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
## permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
## infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
## computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
## distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
## public, and in some countries other activities as well.
## 
##   To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
## parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
## a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
## 
##   An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;
## to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
## feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
## tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
## extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
## work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
## the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
## menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
## 
##   1. Source Code.
## 
##   The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work
## for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source
## form of a work.
## 
##   A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official
## standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
## interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
## is widely used among developers working in that language.
## 
##   The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other
## than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
## packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
## Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
## Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
## implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
## &quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component
## (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
## (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
## produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
## 
##   The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all
## the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
## work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
## control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&#39;s
## System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
## programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
## which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
## includes interface definition files associated with source files for
## the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
## linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
## such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
## subprograms and other parts of the work.
## 
##   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
## can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
## Source.
## 
##   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
## same work.
## 
##   2. Basic Permissions.
## 
##   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
## copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
## conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
## permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
## covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
## content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
## rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
## 
##   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
## convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
## in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
## of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
## with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
## the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
## not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
## for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
## and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
## your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
## 
##   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
## the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
## makes it unnecessary.
## 
##   3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
## 
##   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
## measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
## 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
## similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
## measures.
## 
##   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
## circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
## is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
## the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
## modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s
## users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of
## technological measures.
## 
##   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
## 
##   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you
## receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
## appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
## keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
## non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
## keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
## recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
## 
##   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
## and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
## 
##   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
## 
##   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
## produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
## terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
## 
##     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
##     it, and giving a relevant date.
## 
##     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
##     released under this License and any conditions added under section
##     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
##     &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.
## 
##     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
##     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
##     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
##     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
##     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
##     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
##     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
## 
##     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
##     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
##     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
##     work need not make them do so.
## 
##   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
## works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
## and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
## in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
## &quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
## used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users
## beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
## in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
## parts of the aggregate.
## 
##   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
## 
##   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
## of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
## machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
## in one of these ways:
## 
##     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
##     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
##     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
##     customarily used for software interchange.
## 
##     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
##     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
##     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
##     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
##     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
##     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
##     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
##     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
##     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
##     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
##     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
## 
##     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
##     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
##     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
##     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
##     with subsection 6b.
## 
##     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
##     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
##     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
##     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
##     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
##     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
##     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
##     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
##     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
##     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
##     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
##     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
## 
##     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
##     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
##     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
##     charge under subsection 6d.
## 
##   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
## from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
## included in conveying the object code work.
## 
##   A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any
## tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
## or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
## into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
## doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
## product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a
## typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
## of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
## actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
## is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
## commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
## the only significant mode of use of the product.
## 
##   &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,
## procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
## and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
## a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
## suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
## code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
## modification has been made.
## 
##   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
## specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
## part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
## User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
## fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
## Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
## by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
## if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
## modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
## been installed in ROM).
## 
##   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
## requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
## for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
## the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
## network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
## adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
## protocols for communication across the network.
## 
##   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
## in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
## documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
## source code form), and must require no special password or key for
## unpacking, reading or copying.
## 
##   7. Additional Terms.
## 
##   &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this
## License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
## Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
## be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
## that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
## apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
## under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
## this License without regard to the additional permissions.
## 
##   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
## remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
## it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
## removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
## additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
## for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
## add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
## that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
## 
##     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
##     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
## 
##     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
##     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
##     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
## 
##     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
##     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
##     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
## 
##     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
##     authors of the material; or
## 
##     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
##     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
## 
##     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
##     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
##     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
##     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
##     those licensors and authors.
## 
##   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further
## restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
## received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
## governed by this License along with a term that is a further
## restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
## a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
## License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
## of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
## not survive such relicensing or conveying.
## 
##   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
## must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
## additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
## where to find the applicable terms.
## 
##   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
## form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
## the above requirements apply either way.
## 
##   8. Termination.
## 
##   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
## provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
## modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
## this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
## paragraph of section 11).
## 
##   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
## license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
## provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
## finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
## holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
## prior to 60 days after the cessation.
## 
##   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
## reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
## violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
## received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
## copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
## your receipt of the notice.
## 
##   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
## licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
## this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
## reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
## material under section 10.
## 
##   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
## 
##   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
## run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
## occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
## to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
## nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
## modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
## not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
## covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
## 
##   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
## 
##   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
## receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
## propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
## for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
## 
##   An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an
## organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
## organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
## work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
## transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
## licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could
## give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
## Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
## the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
## 
##   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
## rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
## not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
## rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
## (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
## any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
## sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
## 
##   11. Patents.
## 
##   A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
## License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
## work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.
## 
##   A contributor&#39;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims
## owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
## hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
## by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
## but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
## consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
## purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant
## patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
## this License.
## 
##   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
## patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to
## make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
## propagate the contents of its contributor version.
## 
##   In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express
## agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
## (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
## sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a
## party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
## patent against the party.
## 
##   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
## and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
## to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
## publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
## then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
## available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
## patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
## consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
## license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have
## actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
## covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work
## in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
## country that you have reason to believe are valid.
## 
##   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
## arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
## covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
## receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
## or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
## you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
## work and works based on it.
## 
##   A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within
## the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
## conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
## specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
## work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
## in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
## to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
## the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
## parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
## patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
## conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
## for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
## contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
## or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
## 
##   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
## any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
## otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
## 
##   12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.
## 
##   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
## otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
## excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
## covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
## License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
## not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
## to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
## the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
## License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
## 
##   13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
## Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
## interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
## supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
## Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
## from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
## means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
## shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
## of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
## following paragraph.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
## permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
## under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
## combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
## License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
## but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
## 3 of the GNU General Public License.
## 
##   14. Revised Versions of this License.
## 
##   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
## the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
## will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
## address new problems or concerns.
## 
##   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
## Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
## Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the
## option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
## version or of any later version published by the Free Software
## Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
## GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
## by the Free Software Foundation.
## 
##   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
## versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s
## public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
## to choose that version for the Program.
## 
##   Later license versions may give you additional or different
## permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
## author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
## later version.
## 
##   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
## 
##   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
## APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
## HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY
## OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
## THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
## PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
## IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
## ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
## 
##   16. Limitation of Liability.
## 
##   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
## WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
## THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
## GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
## USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
## DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
## PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
## EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
## SUCH DAMAGES.
## 
##   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
## 
##   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
## above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
## reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
## an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
## Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
## copy of the Program in return for a fee.
## 
##                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
## 
##             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
## 
##   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
## possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
## free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
## 
##   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
## to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
## state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
## the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
## 
##     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
##     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
## 
##     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
##     it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
##     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
##     (at your option) any later version.
## 
##     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
##     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
##     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
##     GNU Affero General Public License for more details.
## 
##     You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
##     along with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
## 
## Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
## 
##   If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
## network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
## get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
## interface could display a &quot;Source&quot; link that leads users to an archive
## of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
## solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
## specific requirements.
## 
##   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
## if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.12</span> The The “GNU Affero General Public License” version 3</h2>
<pre><code>##                     GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
##                        Version 3, 19 November 2007
## 
##  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;
##  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
##  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
## 
##                             Preamble
## 
##   The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
## software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
## cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
## 
##   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
## to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
## our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
## share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
## software for all its users.
## 
##   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
## price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
## have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
## them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
## want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
## free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
## 
##   Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
## with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
## you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
## and/or modify the software.
## 
##   A secondary benefit of defending all users&#39; freedom is that
## improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
## receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
## incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
## encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
## software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
## The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
## letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
## source code to the public.
## 
##   The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
## ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
## to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
## provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
## users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
## a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
## code of the modified version.
## 
##   An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
## published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
## a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
## released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
## this license.
## 
##   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
## modification follow.
## 
##                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
## 
##   0. Definitions.
## 
##   &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
## 
##   &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
## works, such as semiconductor masks.
## 
##   &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
## License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and
## &quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.
## 
##   To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
## in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
## exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the
## earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.
## 
##   A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
## on the Program.
## 
##   To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
## permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
## infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
## computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
## distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
## public, and in some countries other activities as well.
## 
##   To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
## parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
## a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
## 
##   An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;
## to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
## feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
## tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
## extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
## work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
## the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
## menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
## 
##   1. Source Code.
## 
##   The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work
## for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source
## form of a work.
## 
##   A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official
## standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
## interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
## is widely used among developers working in that language.
## 
##   The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other
## than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
## packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
## Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
## Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
## implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
## &quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component
## (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
## (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
## produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
## 
##   The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all
## the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
## work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
## control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&#39;s
## System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
## programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
## which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
## includes interface definition files associated with source files for
## the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
## linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
## such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
## subprograms and other parts of the work.
## 
##   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
## can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
## Source.
## 
##   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
## same work.
## 
##   2. Basic Permissions.
## 
##   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
## copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
## conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
## permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
## covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
## content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
## rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
## 
##   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
## convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
## in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
## of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
## with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
## the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
## not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
## for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
## and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
## your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
## 
##   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
## the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
## makes it unnecessary.
## 
##   3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
## 
##   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
## measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
## 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
## similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
## measures.
## 
##   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
## circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
## is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
## the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
## modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s
## users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of
## technological measures.
## 
##   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
## 
##   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you
## receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
## appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
## keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
## non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
## keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
## recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
## 
##   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
## and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
## 
##   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
## 
##   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
## produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
## terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
## 
##     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
##     it, and giving a relevant date.
## 
##     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
##     released under this License and any conditions added under section
##     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
##     &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.
## 
##     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
##     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
##     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
##     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
##     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
##     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
##     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
## 
##     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
##     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
##     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
##     work need not make them do so.
## 
##   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
## works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
## and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
## in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
## &quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
## used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users
## beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
## in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
## parts of the aggregate.
## 
##   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
## 
##   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
## of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
## machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
## in one of these ways:
## 
##     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
##     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
##     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
##     customarily used for software interchange.
## 
##     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
##     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
##     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
##     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
##     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
##     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
##     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
##     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
##     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
##     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
##     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
## 
##     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
##     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
##     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
##     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
##     with subsection 6b.
## 
##     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
##     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
##     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
##     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
##     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
##     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
##     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
##     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
##     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
##     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
##     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
##     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
## 
##     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
##     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
##     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
##     charge under subsection 6d.
## 
##   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
## from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
## included in conveying the object code work.
## 
##   A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any
## tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
## or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
## into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
## doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
## product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a
## typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
## of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
## actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
## is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
## commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
## the only significant mode of use of the product.
## 
##   &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,
## procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
## and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
## a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
## suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
## code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
## modification has been made.
## 
##   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
## specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
## part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
## User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
## fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
## Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
## by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
## if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
## modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
## been installed in ROM).
## 
##   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
## requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
## for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
## the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
## network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
## adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
## protocols for communication across the network.
## 
##   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
## in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
## documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
## source code form), and must require no special password or key for
## unpacking, reading or copying.
## 
##   7. Additional Terms.
## 
##   &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this
## License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
## Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
## be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
## that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
## apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
## under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
## this License without regard to the additional permissions.
## 
##   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
## remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
## it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
## removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
## additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
## for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
## add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
## that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
## 
##     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
##     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
## 
##     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
##     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
##     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
## 
##     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
##     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
##     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
## 
##     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
##     authors of the material; or
## 
##     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
##     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
## 
##     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
##     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
##     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
##     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
##     those licensors and authors.
## 
##   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further
## restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
## received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
## governed by this License along with a term that is a further
## restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
## a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
## License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
## of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
## not survive such relicensing or conveying.
## 
##   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
## must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
## additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
## where to find the applicable terms.
## 
##   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
## form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
## the above requirements apply either way.
## 
##   8. Termination.
## 
##   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
## provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
## modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
## this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
## paragraph of section 11).
## 
##   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
## license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
## provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
## finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
## holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
## prior to 60 days after the cessation.
## 
##   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
## reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
## violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
## received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
## copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
## your receipt of the notice.
## 
##   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
## licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
## this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
## reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
## material under section 10.
## 
##   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
## 
##   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
## run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
## occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
## to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
## nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
## modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
## not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
## covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
## 
##   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
## 
##   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
## receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
## propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
## for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
## 
##   An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an
## organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
## organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
## work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
## transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
## licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could
## give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
## Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
## the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
## 
##   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
## rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
## not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
## rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
## (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
## any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
## sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
## 
##   11. Patents.
## 
##   A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
## License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
## work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.
## 
##   A contributor&#39;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims
## owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
## hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
## by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
## but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
## consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
## purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant
## patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
## this License.
## 
##   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
## patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to
## make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
## propagate the contents of its contributor version.
## 
##   In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express
## agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
## (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
## sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a
## party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
## patent against the party.
## 
##   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
## and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
## to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
## publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
## then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
## available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
## patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
## consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
## license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have
## actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
## covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work
## in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
## country that you have reason to believe are valid.
## 
##   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
## arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
## covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
## receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
## or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
## you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
## work and works based on it.
## 
##   A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within
## the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
## conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
## specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
## work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
## in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
## to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
## the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
## parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
## patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
## conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
## for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
## contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
## or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
## 
##   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
## any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
## otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
## 
##   12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.
## 
##   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
## otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
## excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
## covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
## License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
## not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
## to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
## the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
## License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
## 
##   13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
## Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
## interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
## supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
## Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
## from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
## means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
## shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
## of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
## following paragraph.
## 
##   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
## permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
## under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
## combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
## License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
## but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
## 3 of the GNU General Public License.
## 
##   14. Revised Versions of this License.
## 
##   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
## the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
## will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
## address new problems or concerns.
## 
##   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
## Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
## Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the
## option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
## version or of any later version published by the Free Software
## Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
## GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
## by the Free Software Foundation.
## 
##   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
## versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s
## public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
## to choose that version for the Program.
## 
##   Later license versions may give you additional or different
## permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
## author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
## later version.
## 
##   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
## 
##   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
## APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
## HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY
## OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
## THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
## PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
## IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
## ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
## 
##   16. Limitation of Liability.
## 
##   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
## WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
## THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
## GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
## USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
## DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
## PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
## EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
## SUCH DAMAGES.
## 
##   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
## 
##   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
## above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
## reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
## an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
## Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
## copy of the Program in return for a fee.
## 
##                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
## 
##             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
## 
##   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
## possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
## free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
## 
##   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
## to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
## state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
## the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
## 
##     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
##     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
## 
##     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
##     it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
##     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
##     (at your option) any later version.
## 
##     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
##     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
##     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
##     GNU Affero General Public License for more details.
## 
##     You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
##     along with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
## 
## Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
## 
##   If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
## network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
## get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
## interface could display a &quot;Source&quot; link that leads users to an archive
## of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
## solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
## specific requirements.
## 
##   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
## if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary.
