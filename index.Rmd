# Licensing R {-}

> Licensing for a package which might be distributed is an important but potentially complex subject.

## Disclaimer {-}

__This book is by no mean a legal book and should not be used as such. __

This book aims at helping you decipher the complexity of open source licenses, but if you have legal concerns and questions about open source licenses, __please refer to a professional lawyer__.



This book focuses on licensing R and R-related works. Hence a focus is made on GPL licenses (which are the licenses under which R is released). 

If you think there is a mistake somewhere, or if you want to contribute, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/licensing-r/issues).

## What is this book about  {-}

This book aims at two things: 

- Documenting the current state of licensing in the R world

- Helping developers make strategic choices about the license they apply to their R packages by summarizing and explaining licenses and technical terms specific to open source licensing.

## Content  {-}

+ [Chapter 1 - Introduction](#intro) explores the current state of Open Source licenses by the number, by downloading and exploring the data from CRAN and BioConductor databases.
+ [Chapter 2 - What is a license (and why you should care)](#whatis) gives a series of definition about common terms you'll find while browsing software licenses.  
+ [Chapter 3 - Licenses in the R World](#rworld) 
+ [Chapter 4 - Common patterns for licensing R](#rlicense)
+ [Chapter 5 - A Practical Guide](#practical) 
+ [Chapter 6 - Summary](#summary)
